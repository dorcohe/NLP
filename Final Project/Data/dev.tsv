271	3.0	a	Antie’s stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves, which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate (Arnold, et al, 1996, as cited in Gordon & Mehdiabadi, 1999), receptors to detect food, and receptors for three types of pheromones: those released by successful foragers returning with food, those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest, and those marking piles of trash as midden.
272	3.0	a	I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot (hereafter referred to as Antie) that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest, switching between the foraging, patrolling and midden work behaviors.
273	3.0	a	Almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section.
274	3.0	a	A few sub-behaviors will be necessary for more than one behavior.
275	3.0	a	Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests, intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive (Gordon, 11).
276	3.0	a	Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil.
277	3.0	a	These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis, and when combined with the forward cruise function, should cause the robot to move at an angle.
278	3.1	a	We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees, positive or negative, and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters.
279	3.0	a	The first function might look something like this:
280	3.2	a	In-nest navigation will be a function of the temperature, read by Antie’s thermometer and a light source.
281	2.88	a	Little is known about brood care, as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest.
282	3.11	a	Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest, but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest (midden work) occurs close enough to the surface to be observable.
283	3.0	a	Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis:
284	2.7	a	All three are void and take no inputs.
285	3.0	a	When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously, Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate.
286	3.1	a	Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age (ex., Ingram, et al, 2005) and partially as a function of interactions with other workers (ex., Schafer et al, 2006; Gordon, 2002; Greene & Gordon, 2007).
287	3.1	a	Midden work, which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside, will occur first; patrolling, which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside, will occur second; and foraging will be the final behavior.
288	3.0	a	Finally, I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors.
289	2.9	a	As previously stated, a midden worker must identify midden, grasp it, and carry it to the surface, depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden.
290	3.0	a	It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling.
291	2.9	a	The integers nestpatrol_age and trailpatrol_age will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks.
292	3.0	a	The code might look like this:
293	3.12	a	An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest, wander around searching for food sources, identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is.
294	3.1	a	Of course, what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task-switching between these larger behaviors.
295	3.0	a	Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot.
296	3.0	a	Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate.
297	3.0	a	Chassis
298	3.1	a	Antie be a circular robot, no more than 1cm in diameter (the length of a red harvester ant), with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization.
299	3.14	a	Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance.
300	3.0	a	Sensors
301	3.0	a	The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function.
302	3.0	a	Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees Celsius (Gordon, 9), and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable in-nest navigation.
303	3.0	a	Antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ant’s eyes.
304	3.1	a	The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects.
305	3.0	a	This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest, given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos, et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning.
306	2.6	a	But they have chosen not to attack, perhaps because they are waiting to produce an effect even greater than the 9/11 attacks, so they do not appear to be losing strength.
307	2.9	a	But this claim is merely feel-good propaganda, intended to keep the neo-cons in power.
308	2.1	a	"By trying to ""stamp out"" terrorism by killing terrorists, Bush and Israel have made things infinitely worse for us: more dangerous, not safer."
309	2.9	a	"TERRORISM is ""the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective."
310	2.4	a	We believe that any terrorist act is a crime against humanity and against the will of God, because it deliberately intends to injure and kill innocent people.
311	2.7	a	So you end up fighting the entire population.
312	2.92	a	Beyond these two sources, there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world, with the possible exception of localized disputes such as in Northern Ireland and occasional domestic episodes in various places involving isolated disaffected groups.

318	3.1	a	but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition.
319	3.0	a	As mentioned, the first theme, the beginning of which is reproduced in Example 8, contains two head motives: the first is the tritone-spanning ascent that appears in the first measure, and the second is an iteration of the interval cell (+5, -2, +5) that appears in the second through third measures.
320	3.0	a	Rather, this motive is a small-scale representation of the tonic-dominant relationship of tritone partners, specifically F and B, that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement.
321	3.0	a	While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion, it is perfectly accurate: the movement is in sonata form, but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement (not unheard of in Mozart sonatas), and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order.
322	2.9	a	We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in F—this is made clear from the onset, both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77.
323	3.0	a	The trombone motive in measures 134-141, shown in Example 12, is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development, although its importance is downplayed here.
324	3.1	a	The descent in measures 91-95 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on C, which makes the eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger.
325	3.0	a	The “backwards” recapitulation is a technique that Bartók employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates.
326	3.0	a	For example, the fifth string quartet.
327	3.0	a	Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on “a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],”

329	3.0	a	Although it moves to E♭ minor in measure 239, it returns to D minor in measure 248, which suggests that E♭ is an upper neighbor prolonging D.
330	2.9	a	The second section of the development is in C♯ (which is sometimes spelled D♭).
331	3.0	a	This section returns to the calm simplicity (and tempo) of the second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section.
332	3.0	a	Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293, preceded by A♭ major (V) in measure 285, suggests C♯ as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303.
333	2.8	a	The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development (Example 15), which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯.
334	3.0	a	As the example shows, the development section is divided into three subsections; the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group, and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition.
335	3.0	a	The tonal center B♭ is established immediately in measures 316-318 by the strong V-I chord progression (Example 16).
336	3.0	a	It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D, which constitutes another “filling in” of the whole-step by the intervening fourth.
337	3.1	a	Firstly, its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it; the first chord in Example 9 is an F-minor triad, and the first four notes of Example 8 ascend the F-minor scale.
338	3.0	a	See Wilson, 168-170.
339	3.0	a	References
340	3.0	a	When we say “in F,” we do not imply F major (or minor, for that matter)—the major/minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece—but rather that the pitch-class F is the tonal center of the movement, and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement.
341	3.0	a	Using this interpretation, we can map out the local tonics (tonal centers) used throughout the movement, as shown in Example 2.
342	3.0	a	Tonal Structure and Form in Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra (I)
343	3.29	a	Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg.
344	3.0	a	The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale.
345	2.9	a	Indeed, this set can be seen more as a by-product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself.
346	2.9	a	We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths; indeed, the structural whole-tone descent is often “filled in” with the intervening fourth.
347	3.0	a	So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement, within the first 29 measures we can already see structural, harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole.
348	3.0	a	The section from measures 35-50 is centered on E; upon the return of D♯, enharmonically respelled as E♭, in measure 58, we see that E acts as its upper-neighbor.
349	3.0	a	This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51-57 however; while there is no clear tonal center for this section, G appears in the outer voices in measure 51, although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor.
350	3.12	a	Because of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonize

438	3.2	a	Thus originated Las Vegas’s reputation as an adult theme park.
439	3.1	a	Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis.
440	3.1	a	Frank Sinatra, Wayne Newton, and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were written.
441	2.89	a	Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash.
442	2.9	a	Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities.

445	3.0	a	The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US.
446	2.89	a	Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business.
447	2.9	a	They can no longer be just a box filled with gaming tables, restaurants, and a showroom.
448	3.1	a	The crème de la crème of Las Vegas deluxe is Steve Wynn’s Bellagio.
449	3.22	a	Perhaps more important, such high-end accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the mythology of the Rat Pack era.
450	3.1	a	As it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming venue, the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed.
451	3.38	a	Inevitably, some people will get burned in the process, but others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes.
452	3.0	a	And that, more than anything, is the one constant that characterizes the past, present, and future of Las Vegas.
453	3.0	a	Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert, the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years.
454	2.9	a	The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries.
455	2.7	a	The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the desert, trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their circumstances and spread the Mormon faith.
456	3.2	a	One opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass.
457	2.8	a	In the late 1870s, he defaulted on a loan from rancher Archibald Stewart, so Stewart took the Las Vegas Ranch for his own.
458	3.0	a	Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail, this was about to change quickly.
459	3.0	a	Standing at the depot at Main and Fremont streets, railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub.
460	3.0	a	By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas.
461	3.2	a	The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place.
462	2.88	a	But such heady progress would soon come to a halt.

464	3.0	a	Therefore, neither homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a “choice” in the matter, and asking a homosexual “Why are you attracted to other members of your sex” is likened to asking a heterosexual “Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?”
465	3.1	a	Rather, the only actual choice is whether or not to be open with one’s sexuality and sexual preference; whether to act on one’s sexual desires, whether to tell others about such feelings, or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions (Marcus 9).
466	3.0	a	Both were asked how what they thought determined homosexuality (nature vs. nurture) and why, when they realized they were homosexual and how they knew, and similar questions.

468	3.0	a	He added that “nothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it’s always been there.
469	3.18	a	I’ve always been attracted to guys” (Woods).
470	3.0	a	What, exactly, causes homosexuality?
471	2.88	a	Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something in the development of the embryo.
472	3.8	a	“fascinating.”

474	3.1	a	It’s not black and white [homosexual vs. heterosexual]; it’s a spectrum” (Woods).
475	2.9	a	Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics.
476	3.0	a	My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what causes homosexuality.
477	3.0	a	Nonetheless, I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of genetic and environmental causes.

479	3.0	a	But it was not until 1869 that the term “homosexual” was first used, to describe “a man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex” (Marcus 1).
480	2.9	a	He became known as one of the founding fathers of sexology, and furthered this position when he opened the world’s first sexological institute, the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, in 1919, which was destroyed by the Nazis 15 years later.
481	2.7	a	Hirschfeld largely supported the Urning theory of Karl Ulrichs, with minor additions; he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of homosexuality, but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to “cure” homosexuals with the use of hormone injections.
482	2.62	a	By the mid 1900s, psychotherapy became the most common “cure,” and many homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual preference (Dudley 125).
483	2.8	a	She disagreed with the popular belief at the time that homosexuality was a mental illness, and concluded that there was no significant psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men; “gay” men were no more insane than their “straight” counterparts (Marcus 183).

534	3.0	a	Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves.

537	2.89	a	However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine.

646	2.8	a	Tibbets was a decorated, top-gun pilot, but Karnes could wrangle the military rule book as well as Tibbets could fly.
647	2.5	a	No one was allowed to talk about what they saw or heard, even though most of the 509th had no idea why they were there, except that 15 B-29s were being modified to carry a heavy load.
648	3.0	a	On his metal desk were names of military men being ordered into the organization.
649	2.64	a	An undercover force of Manhattan Project security agents infiltrated the base and bars in the little town of Wendover (population 103) to spy on airmen.
650	2.78	a	"He said that they had split the atom and that we were going to drop an atomic bomb,"""
651	2.75	a	"He said that they had split the atom and that we were going to drop an atomic bomb,"" Karnes said."
652	3.0	a	""""
653	3.1	a	"""I had no idea how you wrote up an award."
654	3.5	a	Karnes, like the hundreds of others gathered along the flight line, was jubilant.
655	3.3	a	Five days later, Japan surrendered and World War II was over.
656	3.1	a	“I will help you find your Rachel.
657	2.33	a	We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I couldn’t tell whether they were abandoned.
658	3.0	a	My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year.
659	2.9	a	In front of a few houses, there were cars parked, but there were almost none on the streets.
660	2.8	a	“Just ignore that,”
661	2.6	a	As we kept driving, the anxiety grew more pronounced.
662	3.0	a	he was already walking toward the squat, brick-windowed building we were parked next to.
663	2.8	a	Someone opened it a crack, then ushered us in.
664	2.91	a	Inside, the building opened up.
665	3.11	a	What up?”
666	2.75	a	The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap.
667	2.22	a	“Who’s the freak?”
668	2.8	a	The hunchbacked man came up to my stomach.
669	3.2	a	He was standing right in front of some blue lights, so I couldn’t see him very well, but I noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin.
670	2.9	a	“Oh, totally,” said the hunchback.
671	3.12	a	He really stood out.
672	3.0	a	He had some rings, too.
673	3.0	a	“Here you go, man.
674	2.6	a	I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through – people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them, and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail.
675	2.8	a	At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional.
676	3.0	a	“Okay, Nathan.
677	2.66	a	He saw that I wasn’t moving.
678	3.11	a	“It’s from Mitch,”
679	2.9	a	I caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye.
680	3.57	a	“You’ve got a deal.
681	2.8	a	“That’s a question you learn not to ask here.
682	2.2	a	Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence.
683	2.6	a	“I don’t know … it was going to be just us tonight.
684	3.0	a	Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated.
685	3.0	a	Its face was small and wrinkled, with penny-sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose.
686	3.0	a	“We’d like to see a man about some garlic.”
687	3.64	a	Please, if we could see him, we would be much obliged.
688	3.0	a	he looked at me “ – to close it.”
689	2.9	a	“ – to close it.”
690	3.9	a	“Thank you.”
691	3.0	a	At the top was one door.
692	3.0	a	We entered.
693	2.7	a	On the bed was a small, ratty man.
694	3.09	a	They’re almost as rare here, and I’ve never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire.”
695	3.7	a	“Oh, thanks, Nepthys, for your confidence-inspiring tales of experience.
696	3.0	a	Don’t forget, she’s your girlfriend.
697	3.37	a	I can hear your heartbeat from over here.”
698	2.29	a	I shut up and tried to breathe.
699	2.55	a	Now: may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire?
700	3.44	a	It would be a great help to us.”
701	2.0	a	She bit the inside of her bottom lip, looking at me like I was breaking her poor, sweet heart.
702	3.0	a	If you would fetch me this stone, I would tell you what I can.”
703	3.12	a	“Of course we will fetch you the stone,”
704	3.7	a	“You have our thanks.”
705	2.8	a	When we reached the street, I expected some sort of temple, or a row of antiquaries, or at least a sleazy, black-market relics merchant.
706	3.1	a	A large woman, similarly decorated, quickly drifted up to us.
707	3.1	a	“Are you?
708	2.78	a	Well, we don’t get many customers asking about that item.
709	3.0	a	“Why, the merchandise, of course,” she said.
710	3.0	a	She opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room.
711	3.1	a	In its center, under a spearing, white light, was a golden table draped with a blue velvet cloth, on which lay a gray, plum-sized rock.
712	2.9	a	she said, seeing his expression, “that would make the stone rather useless.”
713	2.75	a	“how about a pint of his blood?”
714	2.8	a	We don’t – ”
715	3.0	a	“A pint?
716	2.88	a	Madame, I have his health to consider.”
717	2.9	a	“Half a pint, then – and his hair.”
718	2.86	a	“Well, kid, what do you think?
719	3.0	a	Remember, this is your quest.
720	2.2	a	I’m not giving my blood.”
721	3.2	a	“I think it’s a fair deal, considering the return,”
722	3.0	a	There was a wooden chair, where she sat me down and asked me to wait.
723	2.5	a	I thought that I could feel a slight itching.
724	3.1	a	We’ll be done with them before your hair is finished.”
725	2.5	a	Half an hour later, I left the room pale and bald, running my fingers over my scalp.
726	3.1	a	Madame Entera took me back up to the stone’s room, where Nepthys was waiting by the door.
727	2.8	a	“Come on,”
728	2.7	a	I mean, what is this place, really?”
729	3.0	a	“Okay, take elves.”
730	3.0	a	“You figure they’re some Lincoln-green pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory, right?
731	2.62	a	Not in America.
732	3.43	a	When they do decide to do something for real, they’re always the best at it.”
733	3.0	a	He downed the second shot.
734	3.3	a	I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river.
735	3.2	a	I can drink like a fish, kid.
736	3.0	a	I want to see what a magic stone looks like.
737	3.0	a	He thought about it, then handed me the pouch.
738	2.71	a	“Nathan,” said Nepthys, “I think that you just did something very stupid.”
739	3.56	a	“I agree,”
740	3.0	a	“Do you know what this thing does?”
741	2.5	a	but I couldn’t hear him.
742	2.5	a	“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,”
743	2.9	a	“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,” said Nepthys.
744	3.1	a	Her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles, and soft, white leather boots held her feet.
745	3.1	a	“Name me,”
746	2.9	a	I’d never named anyone before.
747	3.29	a	“So …back to our garlicky friend?”
748	3.0	a	“I suppose so,”
749	2.22	a	he screamed.
750	2.7	a	“But …but sir,”
751	3.0	a	I should say, set yourself back, since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for.”
752	2.9	a	Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark.
753	2.88	a	“Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me.
754	3.1	a	First, though, we are getting you a hat.
755	3.11	a	She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure.
756	3.0	a	“he”
757	3.29	a	From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest”.
758	3.2	a	A moment later, he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in.
759	3.0	a	Nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the building’s façade, a vaulted, ribbed intestine of a hallway, whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic.
760	3.9	a	We kissed and slipped inside.
761	3.0	a	These were incontestably male.
762	3.55	a	As she rose, her robes fell open and I realized that, except for what looked like a red silk kimono, she was naked – naked and stunning.
763	3.5	a	I took it and, dropping to one knee, gave her fingers a small kiss.
764	3.11	a	It seemed appropriate.
765	3.3	a	“Now, how can I help the elegantly mannered friend of my Nepthys and his surprising young charge?
766	3.25	a	Nepthys poured out wine for three of us.
767	3.0	a	“May I have a little more of what you gave me before, Nepthys?”
768	2.88	a	Isis’ nostrils twitched slightly.
769	3.2	a	This story might be interesting.
770	3.11	a	“It was part of the price for this girl, who was a rock at the time,” explained Nepthys.
771	3.0	a	“She may be at that,” said Isis, gazing at her.
772	3.75	a	Good, round breasts, too, even though they’re small, they suit her.”
773	3.2	a	“She would have been worth it,”
774	2.9	a	Isis …you know some way to locate the undead, don’t you?”
775	3.0	a	If I know him, I can find him.
776	3.1	a	When I had told her all that I could remember, she blinked her black lashes and said, “I remember him.”
777	2.6	a	I would have sworn to you that he was dead.
778	2.38	a	The glow reflected on her pink face, casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeat-strong cheeks.
779	2.4	a	Tiny drops of blood began to seep out of Isis’ palms as her brow creased.
780	2.44	a	Her candy lips twisted into a frown.
781	2.88	a	The blood in her palms, still filling up, began to ripple.
782	3.11	a	He glanced at me with honest concern, probably the first honest moment he’d shown me: ‘Is she all right?’
783	2.8	a	She gasped and the dark glow went out, taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam.
784	3.0	a	Now Nepthys lunged forward, took her by the arms.
785	2.75	a	“What did you say?”
786	2.8	a	“but he might know that someone’s looking for him. He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden.
787	2.9	a	Hurry, though, and you might find him before he leaves.”
788	3.14	a	A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants.
789	3.0	a	“One of these will lead you out.”
790	3.0	a	“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,” said Nepthys.
791	3.4	a	In a few minutes, we were back to the first door we’d knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us.
792	2.5	a	“That’s odd.
793	2.4	a	He didn’t look very surprised.
794	3.1	a	“Anyway, this is the dance floor, man.
795	2.5	a	Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me, pressing me into the wall, but I took a breath and kept moving.
796	3.17	a	Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me.
797	2.63	a	It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf.
798	2.4	a	he shouted.
799	3.0	a	I shook him off and squeezed between two dancing nymphs, getting almost to the edge of the dance floor.
800	2.5	a	His eyes were glowing red, and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off.
801	2.9	a	The dancers near us tried to clear some space.
802	3.0	a	He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip.
803	3.2	a	The crowd parted for us.
804	2.8	a	We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us.
805	2.75	a	I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us.
806	2.82	a	The panes looked dyed black, and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter.
807	2.8	a	He tossed it to me, and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again, turning to face me.
808	2.75	a	He leapt over the pews, soaring like a grasshopper, and drew a gleaming knife in midair.
809	2.4	a	My arms shook from the force of his throw.
810	2.75	a	I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer, ready to drive the ash spike into his heart.
811	3.0	a	I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me.
812	2.9	a	Then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar.
813	3.1	a	A girl’s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, “Nathan.”
814	3.0	a	“Nathan.”
815	3.3	a	I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing.
816	2.6	a	It was still a mess, but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared.
817	2.4	a	I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which, if she were in a situation where I should be doing something, would probably be never.
818	3.0	a	Last night, walking on West 2nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock.
819	2.4	a	She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her.
820	2.4	a	…Sir, if she’s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time.
821	1.57	a	My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help!
822	2.9	a	I pulled my T-shirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go, but I wasn’t ready for cold.
823	2.75	a	Walking didn’t build up much heat; it just moved the air enough to chill me more.
824	3.0	a	I heard an automatic window roll down.
825	3.0	a	“Hey,” said a male voice, “do you need some help?”
826	3.2	a	“Would you like some help?”
827	3.44	a	“Ah, I think I’m fine, thanks,”
828	3.2	a	Please, hop in.
829	2.63	a	“No thanks, sir!
830	3.2	a	“Nathan Spencer, I offer you help.
831	2.1	a	I advise that you not refuse me a third time.”
832	2.9	a	He met my eyes coolly.
833	2.91	a	I got older and went to school, then to college, and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs, webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything.
834	2.6	a	“That’s enough!
835	2.3	a	However, to American companies already suffering financial setbacks, outdated machinery, and fierce competition, this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford.
836	3.0	a	Since this problem was a national one rather than a local one, the problems that were occurring in Youngstown were not unique.
837	2.9	a	“You just can’t solve a nation-wide problem in a single city.”
838	2.5	a	The decline of the world steel market affected not just Youngstown but the entire steel community in America.
839	3.18	a	Eventually, some religious leaders involved in the Ecumenical Coalition joined forces within community members and former steel mill employees to create the Save Our Valley Campaign.
840	2.6	a	But the Campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding.
841	2.45	a	The Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked one essential component: an actual concrete plan.
842	2.3	a	No one seemed to know just how to go about fixing the problems.
843	3.0	a	Rather than sit back and wait for their jobs to be snatched away, the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able to keep the factories open.
844	3.1	a	From its very first days the Mahoning Valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets.
845	2.7	a	Two blocks over one finds Boardman, a well-off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools.
846	2.9	a	In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride.
847	3.1	a	The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves, something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on.
848	2.5	a	The Decline of the Northeastern Ohio Steel Market: Why Did Attempts by Union Leaders and Concerned Citizens to Revive the Steel Industry Ultimately Fail?
849	2.6	a	Strikes racked the town during the forties, fifties, and sixties, and they were often long and bloody.
850	2.7	a	Black Monday and the Crash of the Steel Industry
851	2.6	a	The announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral, which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin.
852	2.4	a	Between 1977 and 1981, a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25,000 jobs were lost countywide.
853	3.0	a	However, it was clear that, in the words of USWA president Lloyd McBride, “If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”
854	3.22	a	The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they mobilized in a variety of ways.
855	3.12	a	The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively.
856	2.78	a	The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill.
857	3.0	a	Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills.
858	2.78	a	This meant that foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in America, and therefore were able to export a more competitive product.
859	2.7	a	3. Make bombs.
860	3.0	a	The first responsibility should be driving safely.
861	2.86	a	I made eight; the last two were totally pulverized after being jostled in a paper bag for half an hour.

1125	2.8	a	Ignoring the statement, Nathan continued.
1126	2.9	a	"You need not pander to what you imagine their wants are; speak, and they shall listen."""
1127	3.0	a	He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago.
1128	3.0	a	Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper.
1129	3.0	a	Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture.
1130	3.12	a	"""I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,"""
1131	2.6	a	"""What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,"""
1132	2.6	a	"""After all I said the day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self-indulgent fantasy?"""
1133	3.5	a	Besides, the public liked a good, simple romance.
1134	3.8	a	They gazed at each other, lost in the rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before.
1135	2.7	a	Stunned, Allan slowly gathered up the pages and placed them in order.
1136	3.0	a	Nathan read the package of words in silence, his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages.
1137	3.0	a	At long last, Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them.
1138	3.0	a	Opening a side drawer, he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot.
1139	2.9	a	"""So,"""
1140	3.0	a	He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right; although the man was somewhat peculiar, he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight.
1141	2.8	a	These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home.
1142	3.33	a	It was evening, and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last.
1143	2.88	a	As Allan drew closer, he distinguished a new cloud, a pillar rising directly ahead; a road of smoke ascended in the west, its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door.
1144	2.8	a	He watched as the carriage drew still more distant, the horses' hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway.
1145	2.67	a	A mass of flaming wood stood before him, heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house.
1146	2.8	a	He stepped slowly beneath the branches, a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great, swirling eddy, a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow's last breath.
1147	2.7	a	And without that torturous willow, he might be free to write whatever he saw fit.
1148	3.12	a	He found himself along the bank of a low, wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current.
1149	3.1	a	Fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet; the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees, still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers, sprang up where branches reached the ground.
1150	3.1	a	In the author's eye gleamed the lantern's reflection – or was it a reflection?
1151	3.44	a	"""Come, darling,"""
1152	3.14	a	For a few yards, they kicked up dust along the roadway; then they raised their hooves and took to the air.
1153	3.7	a	A magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the sky's glory.
1154	3.2	a	"""Cucumber sandwich?"""
1155	3.1	a	"""Before?"""
1156	2.9	a	"""It's far from a 'penchant,' Arthur."
1157	2.6	a	Arthur grimaced at the vivid description.

1159	2.7	a	"""but how am I to do that?"
1160	2.6	a	"""Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy."
1161	3.0	a	Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right.
1162	2.3	a	His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night, and his clothing had a rumpled look as if, by mere proximity, it had taken on the aspect of his weariness.
1163	2.8	a	The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin.
1164	2.88	a	"""Perhaps you require a rest from writing,"""
1165	2.7	a	"""Perhaps you require a rest from writing,"" suggested Arthur."
1166	3.78	a	"""So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home,"" he said."
1167	3.0	a	"""Nathan?"""
1168	3.0	a	"""You mean, finished another story."""
1169	2.4	a	You know just as well as I that they have no future, no potential.
1170	3.62	a	"""Something saleable; something worth reading, worth writing!"
1171	2.5	a	By the time I finally got a seat at the counter, I was starved.

1175	3.11	a	I stopped so I could take the rest home and taste it again later.
1176	3.2	a	On another topic, I made a discovery there in the Tupelo Honey Cafe, one which I'd like to share with you now.

1331	3.09	a	GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE
1332	2.9	a	Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself: those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone (England 2003: 733).
1333	3.0	a	Nonetheless, in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages, which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language, recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion.
1334	3.0	a	"Within the pan-Mayan movement, there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity: some view the reduction of their language to the status of ""dialect"" devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world; however, despite differences over standardization, the pan-Mayan movement itself is largely cohesive."
1335	3.2	a	An example is the Tukanoans: while considered a single “ethnic group”, they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy, in which members of one language group must marry into another (Jackson 1995: 4).
1336	2.9	a	Indigenous cosmology, or “cosmovision”, is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages; it maintains a concept of culture, defined as “the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with Nature” (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58) and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought.
1337	2.7	a	Customary law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships: tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony, crimes are viewed as imbalances in the community's harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime, but may have influenced the accused to do so.
1338	3.1	a	Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America: The Rediscovery of Language and Identity
1339	3.0	a	Shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence, sharing in their ordeal.
1340	3.2	a	The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms, as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution, but to recapture its spirit in a native, rather than Western discourse (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58-59).
1341	2.8	a	Difficulties arise, however, as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop.
1342	3.1	a	In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility; years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one, and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so.
1343	2.7	a	The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85).
1344	2.9	a	Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly, even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish; indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself.
1345	3.0	a	The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences.
1346	3.29	a	The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century.
1347	3.11	a	However, they also claimed that they were part of a larger group, the working class, whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism; therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker-friendly one (Jackson 1995: 6-7).
1348	2.9	a	This is similar to the situation of Guatemala: the government felt it needed to battle communism, an “armed and dangerous menace within”, plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s (Warren 1993: 25).
1349	2.2	a	In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed, 200,000 Mayans were killed, and over 1 million more were displaced.
1350	2.8	a	The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements.
1351	3.0	a	Pan-Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity; it largely avoids specifically political overtones, instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture (England 2003: 734).
1352	2.62	a	The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool.
1353	2.91	a	It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse .
1354	3.0	a	Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices.
1355	3.0	a	Pan-Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance, a language of power and prestige (England 2003: 736).
1356	3.0	a	Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity, those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups (Jackson 2002: 109).
1357	3.5	a	While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities.
1358	3.0	a	They are ruled by the cabildo, local governing boards formed of community leaders (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 51-52).
1359	3.0	a	The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law, and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57-58).
1360	2.6	a	The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999.

1397	2.82	a	You see, the USDA found a loophole allowing these protections to be lifted for “experimental” activities.
1398	3.0	a	We’ve noted the presence of 68 other species of grassland songbirds in the proposed poison-baited areas ... including the Bobolink, Grasshopper Sparrow, Harris’ Sparrow and Le Conte’s Sparrow.
1399	2.7	a	We simply cannot afford to let the government repeat the mistakes of the past ... and operate this deadly and uncontrolled experiment on wildlife.

1409	3.5	a	Very truly yours,
1410	3.0	a	John Flicker President
1411	3.2	a	Thanks to the help of caring and concerned people like you, Audubon won a temporary halt to this planned killing last spring -- but the USDA’s plans could be up and running for the next blackbird migration, unless we act now.
1412	3.2	a	This morning, I closed my office door to interruptions, sat alone at my desk, and did something I think will please you and everyone in your home.
1413	3.11	a	You may have missed learning the mysteries of the spectacled eider (a duck with an uncertain future) ... missed traveling with us to Asia where we found and followed the last wild tigers... missed marveling at the magic of mangroves.. missed discovering in Peru the newest bird known to science, the barbet.. .but you won’t miss a thing anymore.
1414	3.1	a	There’s still more.
1415	3.22	a	Think of all the ways everyone in your household will benefit from your membership in Audubon.
1416	2.86	a	We simply can’t afford to lose you.
1417	3.12	a	I’ll be waiting for your reply.
1418	3.36	a	I thought about our new, enhanced local efforts, our expanding scientific research and educational programs, our fresh new writing in AUDUBON magazine.
1419	2.9	a	We discussed the foundations: the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma; the four noble truths; karma; defilements; the six perfections.
1420	3.0	a	"""Only if you feel no regret,"""

1422	3.0	a	"""study the brain and the self externally. Ever since the 1920s, their science has been about observation of behavior, questionnaires, recordings of electrical brain activity. But the mind can only be known by you, the person whose mind it is."""
1423	3.0	a	Tibetan Buddhist philosophy also approaches the mind and the self from the inside.
1424	3.2	a	In the afternoon, a group of us gathered outside for a meditation session with Ani Kunga.
1425	3.1	a	Ani Kunga explained several off-session and one on-session technique for dealing with negative emotions (anger, hate, irritation, stress, jealousy, and so on).
1426	3.1	a	All the methods built off the idea that you are in control: anger is an emotion, and you can change your emotions.
1427	3.2	a	If I stay still long enough, if I've achieved a relatively constant level of happiness and satisfaction, I forget that I can and should continue to seek out new ideas and approaches, and incorporate beneficial ones into my life.
1428	3.17	a	"A person is never ""done,"" and so, I'll continue to observe and discuss and study, trying to pick the directions in which I'll change, and trying to make tomorrow better than today."
1429	3.0	a	Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani discuss various lay theories of self-control, noting that the amount of self-control a person has can be seen as either an inherently limited or unlimited resource, and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed (the amount of self-control a person has can change over time, or not).
1430	3.0	a	The studies
1431	3.0	a	The study was testing whether a belief in unlimited, malleable self-control would result in most resolutions, and indeed, this is what was found.
1432	2.9	a	In the first session , the 159 participants read passages about lay theories (much like in study one, but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation), listed the resolutions they were planning on making at New Years, rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions, and filled out individual difference measures (which included a self-efficacy scale).
1433	3.0	a	What does this mean for your resolutions?
1434	2.9	a	Self-efficacy did not have a significant effect on goal-setting.
1435	3.1	a	The tall tumbleweed flag marked it as Chad's to defend now.
1436	1.6	a	You suck.
1437	2.8	a	He looked around, trying not to seem nervous.
1438	2.9	a	Two forts stood on the playground, and a hot, bare battlefield separated them.
1439	2.9	a	They were watching now from well defended spy holes, or maybe they were performing secret experiments and swearing bloody oaths.
1440	2.7	a	Roy shuffled off without argument, his baseball cap pulled low to cover his bald head and brain plug and his shoe laces untied.
1441	3.3	a	Roy had taught him to tie his shoes when Chad was five.
1442	2.4	a	Chad just hung his head.

1722	2.4	a	How long until the memories slip away?
1723	2.8	a	“You can try to hold on,”
1724	2.7	a	“You can try to hold on,” said Ray.
1725	2.7	a	“Struck a nerve, huh?”
1726	2.88	a	said Zheng.
1727	2.43	a	“Sorry,”
1728	3.27	a	Traveling on this ship.”
1729	3.0	a	“How long have you been here?”
1730	2.67	a	“Why don't you know for sure?”
1731	2.1	a	I paced my room that night, unable to sleep.
1732	3.7	a	The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like sex, only better.
1733	3.0	a	“Has anyone ever left?”
1734	3.0	a	Adrienne looked at each of us in turn.
1735	2.6	a	Sarah frowned.
1736	2.9	a	Zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table.
1737	3.1	a	Ray and Zheng exchanged another glance.
1738	3.0	a	Kishori chewed her lip.
1739	2.36	a	Again, there was an uncomfortable moment of silence.
1740	2.9	a	No one contradicted her.
1741	2.7	a	When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around.
1742	3.0	a	“Time passes in a weird way here.
1743	3.0	a	she asked Adrienne.
1744	2.25	a	“I don't want to be here forever.”
1745	2.9	a	“Disappeared,”
1746	2.7	a	“We don't know how or why he left. Or where he went.”
1747	2.78	a	The ship, it was odd and old, either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldn't tell what make it was, and somehow, the crew standing around me fit the same description, a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk.
1748	2.9	a	He glanced around at the rest of us.
1749	2.8	a	“I wouldn't miss this, much.”
1750	2.8	a	I watched Adrienne's eyes move from one face to the next.
1751	3.0	a	“You think that,”
1752	3.0	a	Fact: I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end.
1753	2.22	a	My quarters felt stifling.
1754	3.1	a	I inspected the arrays of entertainment options—abstract, old-style flatscreens, engrossing VR flicks and action games, a selection of quondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity.
1755	2.9	a	A simple contact system for communicating with other people on the ship.
1756	2.7	a	A methodical search of my two adjoining rooms, the ample closet space, and the attached bathroom facility had similarly provided no fodder.
1757	3.0	a	Furniture (dark wood, expensive, polished, no secret compartments), clothes, leftover tray of half-consumed food from the previous day's lunch, toiletries (complete with miniature bottles of sweet-smelling apricot honey lotion), lightscreen, me.
1758	2.9	a	I cornered Adrienne at dinner that night.
1759	3.1	a	My other hand pointedly steered Adrienne to a small table against a wall.
1760	3.0	a	“Tell me,” I said, after we sat, “what you have found.”
1761	2.7	a	It wasn't a question.
1762	3.0	a	“I want to know.”
1763	3.1	a	And listen, when they came round the corner, Ray was with the captain.”
1764	3.0	a	This story, it's our story.
1765	2.33	a	The survivors of the unfortunate accidents, the catastrophic malfunctions, the fateful crashes: this is us.
1766	2.38	a	“That doesn't answer my question,”
1767	2.56	a	Adrienne only picked at her food.
1768	3.1	a	“At least have a drink,”
1769	3.0	a	“At least have a drink,” said Sarah.
1770	2.75	a	“Maybe that's the problem,” said Sarah.
1771	3.1	a	“One hundred and forty-seven is a magic number,” said Sarah.
1772	3.5	a	“You ever heard of Dunbar? Well, we've got the perfect-size group right here.”
1773	2.8	a	“Why doesn't anyone mutiny?”
1774	3.09	a	Adrienne asked.
1775	1.62	a	Adrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust.
1776	3.0	a	The stillness of the room contributed, as did the view.
1777	3.0	a	Black and more black, speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to break the emptiness, if only for a brief time.
1778	2.8	a	All of it was temporary, save for the black.
1779	3.4	a	Once found, we can never be lost.
1780	3.0	a	Everything temporary.
1781	2.91	a	Some things in this world, we have to make them permanent ourselves.
1782	2.9	a	The one thing that wouldn't change.
1783	2.5	a	Maybe everything we did, all the stories we told, maybe it was all lies.
1784	3.14	a	And all of us, we were permanent characters in each others' stories.
1785	3.1	a	I turned to see Adrienne in the doorway.
1786	2.38	a	All these things I do, they're just to pass the time until I die.”
1787	3.12	a	Adrienne looked at me, then back out through the window.
1788	2.56	a	“You don't see a meaning because there is no meaning,”
1789	3.44	a	“Look what I found,”
1790	3.14	a	Jefferson was in the Captain's Lounge,
1791	3.0	a	“What about my crewmates?
1792	3.0	a	A space station.
1793	2.8	a	Ray, he caught me as I pounded on the corridor walls, finding no glass to break.
1794	3.0	a	It passed.
1795	3.0	a	This is my Hotel California.
1796	2.2	a	As much as Jesse had irritated me, I didn't like the picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave, body swollen and bloated.
1797	3.1	a	“We're selective about our passengers,” he continued.
1798	3.0	a	Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter about his girl back on Earth and that all-expenses-paid vacation-for-two she won last time he was on leave.
1799	3.0	a	The occasional painting hung on the wall (generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met, primarily).
1800	3.4	a	Glimpses of elegant rooms down the branching hallways; music; voices; the aroma of real food.
1801	3.0	a	I asked.
1802	2.9	a	“No, I meant, where's the ship going? What's our destination?”
1803	3.0	a	What's our destination?”
1804	2.8	a	Tiffany, she stopped walking.
1805	2.12	a	After watching my ship tear apart, after spending a good twenty-three hours floating in silence in the wreck, wondering whether I was currently facing stars belonging to the constellation Libra or the constellation Orion when those stars were viewed from Earth, wondering what it felt like to suffocate, and after the feeling that yes, I was in fact going to die alone in space had sunk in, it took time for that feeling to dissipate.
1806	2.88	a	After I realized this, I left my quarters.
1807	2.4	a	It hadn't seemed relevant, somehow, given that I was still reeling over the explosion, the deaths of my crewmates, and the rescue.
1808	2.9	a	I did a lot of staring and not moving.
1809	2.6	a	Fact: If, before all the air is sucked out of the ship, a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into a space suit, that person has less than twenty-four hours to live.
1810	3.2	a	Luxurious, even compared to the fare one would find in the high-class space stations and pleasure cruisers.
1811	3.8	a	“Liking the taste of the sweet life, eh?
1812	3.33	a	She looked me over approvingly.
1813	3.37	a	“Come on, let's get you a glass of champagne.”
1814	2.29	a	He made me a little uncomfortable.
1815	1.88	a	Still others are less obvious but just as horrible; dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers; baby calves confined and malnourished to provide “milk-fed” veal for the gourmet; and the “accidental” drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen.
1816	3.0	a	“milk-fed”
1817	2.3	a	What is even more shocking, is that more than 30 million animals die these cruel, painful deaths each year ...
1818	3.0	a	Since 1954, our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties.
1819	3.0	a	We also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local, state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty.
1820	3.22	a	Your name -- and the name of The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) -- are very important to the well-being of all animals because together we can prevent suffering and save lives.
1821	3.0	a	Our primary goal, though, has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens, so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering, abuse and exploitation.
1822	2.4	a	Please help us carry this message to others so that animal cruelty and abuse can be eliminated.
1823	3.0	a	P.S. We are totally committed to putting an end to all forms of animal cruelty and neglect.
