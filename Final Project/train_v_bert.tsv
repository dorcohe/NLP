20	3.5	a	Your gift is a wise investment in the community.
21	3.88	a	"For every dollar donated to Goodwill in 1998, we helped our ""graduates"" earn an estimated $102."
22	3.25	a	That money was then spent in a variety of ways, adding fuel to our thriving economy.
23	3.7	a	She tells me that the 3,666 people we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $49 million dollars.
24	3.4	a	A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill's help.
25	3.6	a	Your gift to Goodwill will help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly support our work.
26	3.0	a	What kind of work does Goodwill do?
27	3.29	a	Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities.
28	3.43	a	After Maureen's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant, we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in the middle of society.
29	3.6	a	Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment barrier, the positive effects radiate throughout our community:
30	3.0	a	Parents act as role models of self-sufficiency instead of dependency.
31	3.12	a	Tax dollars that would have been spent on public assistance are saved.
32	2.7	a	You and I know that solutions to difficult problems don't just happen.
33	3.8	a	At Goodwill, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day:
34	3.0	a	A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients:
35	3.0	a	"""You can earn the money to support yourself and your family,"" she says."
36	3.1	a	November 15, 1996

38	3.12	a	I know you can...
39	3.1	a	"I did."""
40	2.82	a	His job objectives call for him to do it in 30.
41	3.46	a	once his tears have subsided, he confirms what his classmates have already figured out: he just received a job offer -- his first in five years.
42	3.27	a	Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center, a Goodwill staff member tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs.
43	3.09	a	At the next corner he tells five more.
44	3.11	a	In order to develop job skills, a man with some serious disabilities begins working in Goodwill's industrial division.
45	2.86	a	He has no time to waste.
46	2.62	a	It takes a long time for him to gain the self-confidence to work elsewhere in the community.
47	3.25	a	These people and their successes are real.
48	3.0	a	Neither do we.
49	3.0	a	Just like the respect we've earned from U.S. News & World Report.

59	3.57	a	"In their December, 1995 review of the nation's best charities, U.S. News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five ""Standout Good Guys."""
60	3.4	a	In the short while since Goodwill helped him find his job, Robert has learned to thoroughly clean a motel room in about 40 minutes.
61	3.4	a	"The magazine stated that Goodwill (as well as the other standouts) is ""uniquely effective, innovative or valuable."""
62	2.9	a	While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report's endorsement, the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us.
63	2.9	a	And there are a lot of people who face these challenges every day of their lives.
64	3.14	a	So our work must continue.
65	3.5	a	Everyone benefits from the work we do together.
66	2.9	a	Many people need our help.

70	3.0	a	James M. McClelland President
71	3.7	a	We've helped people break free of the welfare cycle.
72	3.38	a	We've found ways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce.
73	3.0	a	December 10, 1996
74	3.4	a	We've expanded Goodwill's proven methods to towns and neighborhoods where they are needed most.
75	3.1	a	Of course, we've played different roles.
76	3.0	a	Dear Mailhouse donor reminder:
77	3.0	a	Who has benefited from our partnership?
78	2.9	a	Everyone has.
79	3.6	a	When you and I help somebody find a job, one more person joins the ranks of tax payers, fewer tax dollars are spent on public assistance and businesses gain another consumer.
80	3.6	a	You and I have done some important work together.
81	2.67	a	There are a lot of barriers that keep people from working: physical and mental disabilities, history of welfare dependency and lack of education or self-esteem.
82	3.78	a	At last, he has found success in a job that he loves.
83	2.86	a	Like Michael, they share two common characteristics.
84	3.0	a	They face some barrier to employment and they want to work.
85	3.38	a	And then the pay-off begins for the entire community.
86	3.4	a	Last year, participants in Goodwill programs earned --and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $3.5 million.
87	3.3	a	Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job.
88	3.0	a	November 15, 1994
89	3.0	a	The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents, however.
90	3.2	a	The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms of a house to live in, money to purchase food -- without food stamps -- and the beginning of a family focused on success, not hopelessness.
91	3.0	a	Won't you help make all of these successes possible?
92	3.6	a	Your gift will help give new meaning to the word success -- for people who have seldom had reason to use the word.
93	2.14	a	Michael was born with cerebral palsy.
94	3.25	a	Sincerely,
95	3.0	a	James M. McClelland President
96	3.6	a	For every dollar of public support Goodwill received last year, we returned $1.59 to the community in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments.
97	2.38	a	His most recent job lasted only a year before cut-backs eliminated his position.
98	2.22	a	For 18 long months Michael could not find a job.
99	3.44	a	Think of your greatest accomplishments.
100	2.7	a	He resorted to public assistance dollars to survive.
101	3.6	a	At Goodwill, Michael's counselors felt that his personable demeanor could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job-match where his people skills could shine.
102	3.6	a	After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person for the job.
103	4.0	a	Think of the joy and success they bring to you and your loved ones.
104	2.6	a	Their complaint: the system discourages working because unemployment provides benefits that many entry-level jobs don't include.
105	3.0	a	Some of the strongest critics of our welfare system are the people who have become dependent on it.
106	3.1	a	That's where you --and Goodwill --come in.
107	3.25	a	We help people train for and find jobs that make it possible for them to get off of welfare.
108	3.8	a	Last year, Goodwill placed 511 people in jobs, more than double the number we placed in 1993.
109	2.7	a	While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea, the people who need jobs are floundering.
110	2.8	a	And welfare reform is an uncertain solution with an unknown starting date.
111	3.87	a	Goodwill works.
112	2.86	a	Right now.
113	3.2	a	Please give the largest gift you can to Goodwill today.
114	3.0	a	Sincerely, Jack Dustman Chairman
115	2.3	a	With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana, many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment.
116	2.9	a	Some, like Jerry, are ex-offenders.
117	2.57	a	Some are blind, deaf or have other physical disabilities.
118	3.4	a	But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to overcome, like Jerry.
119	3.5	a	With a promising new job at a plastic injection molding manufacturer, his legal troubles in check and a safe place to live, Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself and contributing to his community.
120	3.0	a	March 17, 2000
121	3.0	a	For as long as he needs it, Goodwill will continue to help.
122	3.5	a	Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful employment.
123	3.43	a	And, with your assistance, Goodwill can help employers develop resources to keep workers on the job.
124	3.29	a	Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending a gift to Goodwill.
125	3.56	a	Your generosity will help people help themselves.
126	2.0	a	Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up on the street.
127	3.0	a	Name Address City, ST, Zip
128	3.0	a	He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps until he could find a job and a place to live.
129	3.2	a	The Trustee referred him to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill's Career Academy staff for job search assistance.
130	3.0	a	Dear Name:
131	2.5	a	But Jerry's troubles didn't end there.
132	2.89	a	The seasonal construction job he obtained soon ended, and he returned to Career Academy for help once more.
133	3.0	a	Such fund are often used for college tuition, vocational training or a deposit on an apartment.
134	2.29	a	Without private donor support, this Fund doesn't exist.
135	3.12	a	Please take a few minutes to send a donation to help one or more of our children successfully cross that threshold into the future.
136	3.22	a	Sincerely,
137	2.9	a	Mary Roth Executive Director
138	3.0	a	The young adults who leave Pleasant Run have those same feelings.
139	2.5	a	Very few have family support to get them started.
140	2.62	a	Many need furniture, linens and other basic necessities to begin lives on their own.
141	3.0	a	Name Address City, ST Zip
142	3.2	a	To help them establish themselves in the community, the Pleasant Run Emancipation fund was begun in 1993 by private donors who wanted to provide a measure of financial support for those leaving our programs.
143	3.2	a	Individuals who are being emancipated are eligible to receive up to $500 from the Fund if they formally apply and meet four requirements:
144	3.22	a	Dear ,
145	3.0	a	1. Release by the courts
146	3.5	a	2. Successful completion of all life skills tests
147	3.1	a	Do you remember the combination of elation and apprehension you felt when you first left home?
148	2.88	a	3. Positive termination of his or her Pleasant Run program
149	3.29	a	4. Possession of a high school diploma or GED
150	3.0	a	Proof of meeting these, two staff reference letters and an essay stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all reviewed by a Pleasant Run panel, which determines if the applicant merits the funds.
151	3.0	a	Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil War.
152	2.6	a	Today, we serve children and families with a multitude of problems: emotional, physical, psychological and sexual abuse.
153	3.3	a	Some come from families where, through therapy, there is hope for reunification.
154	3.2	a	"For others, ""families"" are the counselors are housemates at the group homes where they live."
155	2.36	a	The biggest tragedy is that the problems don't go away; they only grow.
156	3.5	a	In 1995 we will serve over 850 children and 340 families.
157	3.0	a	In 1996, these figures will triple.
158	3.63	a	The children and families who come to Pleasant Run are given the opportunity to become happy, loving, and productive members of our society.
159	3.5	a	They welcome the chance to belong, to become self- sufficient, to regain their self-esteem and confidence.
160	3.3	a	Often it is a long, hard struggle, but the results are well worth it.
161	2.7	a	For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children and their families, we need your support.
162	2.71	a	The Funding sources are shrinking, but the needs grow explosively.
163	3.2	a	"Please ""help good kids get better"" by sending us a contribution today."

169	1.9	a	Families are being torn apart, and too often, children are the victims.
170	3.1	a	What kind of people benefit by your contribution to Pleasant Run Children's Homes?
171	2.29	a	Kids like Tommie J., made a ward of the court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic father;
172	2.5	a	Alice, sent to a group home to get help because of severe behavior disorders;
173	3.1	a	Pleasant Run Children's Homes began serving children nearly 130 years ago.
174	2.7	a	For some, it's a matter of weeks or months;
175	2.78	a	for others, it's years.
176	3.0	a	We wouldn't exist if the need weren't there.
177	3.1	a	The numbers of children who deserve our services are rising... as quickly as our programs can grow to serve them.

182	3.11	a	Federal, state and local governments are freezing or withdrawing much-needed funding sources for people who are truly in need.
183	2.43	a	We all hear about today's increases in neglect, abuse and abandonment of those who can't fight back: children.
184	2.8	a	This is not newsletter.
185	3.0	a	Yet few of us hear enough about kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade.

191	3.44	a	Your contribution will make a difference in a child's life.
192	3.78	a	It can certainly make happy holiday memories.
193	3.55	a	A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have presents to open.
194	3.33	a	A gift means a family will have a holiday meal, cooking utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on.
195	3.5	a	Your gift will go beyond the holiday season.
196	3.25	a	Please take a few minutes to mail a donation to Pleasant run.
197	3.4	a	Let our families and children know that you want them to have the same kinds of memories of the holidays you will have.

201	4.0	a	This is the time of year when we give thanks for the warmth and love that surrounds us.
202	2.7	a	And this time of year is an occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are.
203	3.2	a	Pleasant Run cares for at-risk children and families.
204	3.0	a	We do this through a wide range of programs including community- based, therapeutic foster care, group homes and our treatment center.
205	2.33	a	Many of the children are victims of abuse or live in unstable homes.
206	3.12	a	Today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a contribution to Pleasant Run to help the 1,500 children families we care for.
207	2.12	a	Many of the children have no homes; no memories of joy from past holidays.
208	2.4	a	Others are from families that are struggling to provide a healthy, happy environment but don't have the resources to make it possible.
209	3.0	a	If you are interested and would like more information, please contact Lisa Lusk or Marcia Whited at 693-9222.
210	3.0	a	We would like to have families matched with sponsors non later than xxxx.
211	3.78	a	Thank you for considering this opportunity to make this a memorable holiday season for a family in need.
212	3.2	a	Sincerely,
213	3.1	a	It's hard to believe that the holiday season is only two months away.
214	3.1	a	Every year we seek companies, organizations and individuals to sponsor one or more of our families.
215	3.4	a	These programs focus on keeping the family together by providing counseling and other services to the entire family.
216	2.5	a	After our caseworkers meet with these families and their children they often find they lack even the basic necessities such as cooking utensils, beds, cleaning supplies, etc.
217	2.25	a	But, the holiday season is a particularly difficult time for these families.
218	2.44	a	They do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a holiday meal.
219	3.1	a	We are asking you to consider sponsoring one of our families for this holiday season.
220	3.1	a	At Pleasant Run, Inc. we are making plans and arrangements for our children and families.
221	2.9	a	It costs $225 to send one child to camp.
222	3.1	a	Many members of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis can't afford to go to camp without financial assistance, and that's why we need you!
223	3.11	a	Please make camp possible for all deserving Indianapolis children and send in a tax deductible contribution today in the enclosed envelope.

283	3.4	a	Two of them told me yesterday that as a group they decided they had to earn the right to ask others for help by accomplishing something real to help themselves.
284	3.3	a	Even after the summer sessions come to a close, Jameson campers will take part in year-round programs designed to keep that positive contact with peers and role models alive and important.
285	3.4	a	We've scheduled more than 15 follow-up camper weekends beginning in September and going around till next summers camping season.
286	3.2	a	Please, consider renewing your support of these great kids today.
287	3.0	a	Sincerely,
288	3.0	a	P.S.
289	3.1	a	If you can give a little more to help meet this increased expense we would appreciate your support.
290	3.2	a	All of our Six summer camping sessions are booked to capacity (and, truth be told, with maybe one our two extra returning campers squeezed in) and we have a waiting list of 60 children who are hoping to come if a spot should open.
291	3.0	a	Dear Name,
292	3.5	a	What a Summer!
293	3.1	a	Many more camper referrals are coming from new organizations such as school social-workers and family counseling agencies.
294	2.8	a	It seems summer options aren't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes, so we're doing all we can to make Jameson available.
295	3.5	a	And we're just getting started!
296	3.0	a	"That ""we"" includes the Youth Leadership teens."
297	3.25	a	These 60 or so campers have takenon a fund raiser with a goal of raising $16,000 for camperships.
298	3.29	a	An understanding that, above anything else, success requires genuine effort, a willingness to set challenging goals.
299	3.0	a	In just the past few years this program has grown from a few kids and a few extra activities to a team of almost 60 young adults taking on real projects.
300	3.09	a	YL teens will make J.C. juniors happen again this year for 7 and 8 year old campers.
301	3.6	a	A five day camp, J.C. juniors introduces at-risk children to Jameson two years earlier than we could previously reach them.
302	3.9	a	That means we now have the opportunity to be a stable, positive and important part of each child's life for an entire decade.
303	3.3	a	The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them.
304	3.0	a	And their activities aren't isolated to Jameson.
305	3.5	a	The teens have undertaken a volunteer project to regularly visit with sick children at a local hospital.
306	3.0	a	June 10, 1997
307	3.1	a	Please consider renewing your gift today.
308	3.0	a	The kids need your leadership now more than ever.
309	3.0	a	If you can increase your last donation, we would appreciate that show of support for the campers and their efforts to overcome obstacles and create successful lives.
310	4.11	a	Thank you again for helping point the way.
311	3.0	a	Sincerely,
312	3.0	a	Julie Marsh, Executive Director
313	3.0	a	P.S.
314	3.14	a	These are the attributes we want all children to have.
315	3.2	a	You help Jameson campers reach for them.
316	2.88	a	Name Address City, ST Zip
317	3.11	a	Jameson points the way for children who need that extra hand and I hope you'll continue your support this year.
318	3.5	a	You're last gift of $50.00 helped make it possible for us to provide guidance, encouragement and fun to nearly 400 Indianapolis area children.
319	3.0	a	And not just during the summer, but throughout the year.
320	3.4	a	Confidence.
321	3.5	a	The best indicator I can give you of the positive effect our year-round contact has is the growth in and deeds of the Youth Leadership teens.
322	3.25	a	The Summer Enrichment Program will conclude with a celebration that includes family and friends.
323	3.0	a	We would like to offer our youth a small reward for their participation by presenting them with gift certificates from Target.
324	3.0	a	Therefore, we are asking you to donate 45, $10 gift certificates that can be used toward the purchase of school supplies or clothing, in the total amount of $450.
325	3.12	a	In return, we will recognize Target as a sponsor during our event and in the event program.
326	3.6	a	I will be happy to supply any additional information you may need and thank you for your consideration of our request.
327	3.6	a	We look forward to hearing from you.

333	3.5	a	The centers that serve these areas, Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, Hawthorne Community Center, Southwest Multi-Service Center, and Christamore House, have teamed up to run an exciting job readiness program for 14 and 15 year old area residents called the Summer Enrichment Program.
334	3.1	a	Dear Mr. Ratcliff:
335	3.12	a	CCI is a federation of 13 neighborhood-based multi-service centers whose mission is to identify and meet the human service needs of residents throughout Marion County in the most effective, efficient and comprehensive way possible.
336	3.1	a	Between June 21 and August 31, 45 youth will spend 20 hours a week developing life management and work ethic skills, learning the computer, visiting area colleges, and interacting with guest speakers.
337	3.3	a	With this in mind, I am asking each one of you to make a personal contribution of $50, $100 or even $1,000 to show that you believe in the work that we do and are willing to support it with both your time and your finances.
338	3.2	a	CCI has come a long way in the last five years.
339	3.12	a	This way when we go out to ask for community support and are asked about our board giving level, we can show our in-house commitment through 100% board participation.
340	3.0	a	I also encourage you to seek additional support through your company, church, or service organization.
341	3.7	a	We've worked hard to structrue the organization so that we've ready to move boldly into the next century, and I believe that we have an exciting and successful future ahead of us.
342	3.0	a	I know that our staff and committee members will be happy to go with you to talk to these group if you need their help.
343	3.8	a	We're at an exciting juncture and it won't be long until we start seeing solid results from our efforts.

350	3.12	a	One of the areas we've decided to focus on is development.
351	2.9	a	It's clear that if we don't increase our base of private funding, we won't have the kind of control we need to ensure the continued success of our centers and the very important services they offer.
352	2.9	a	In 1998, CCI served 31,484 individuals right in their own backyards.
353	2.9	a	Where else would that many people turn if CCI weren't there to help?
354	3.0	a	Dear LTR_NAME:

379	3.25	a	As a provider of youth services, MCCOY, Inc. is here to support your valuable efforts to develop young people.
380	3.44	a	Recently, through a lot of hard work and alliances with organizations like yours, some steps have been taken in our community that will help young people continue to be involved in positive activities.
381	3.12	a	In 1998, MCCOY, Inc. led two efforts that, we believe, will help our community continue to take the steps necessary to help all young people grow up and develop well.
382	3.2	a	One, IndyGo in April adopted a much-needed policy that all young people under the age of 19 may ride on their buses at half the normal fare all year long.
383	3.3	a	Two, funding was made available this summer for youth organizations and churches to conduct positive youth programming on Saturday evenings.
384	2.6	a	Through the youth mapping process, it was confirmed that the positive opportunities for youth on weekend evenings were lacking.
385	3.3	a	That need is being met.
386	3.3	a	As it has been an exciting year for all of us, MCCOY, Inc. cannot do its part without the support of organizations like yours.
387	3.12	a	Annually, we ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort to help young people grow up well in Indianapolis.
388	3.36	a	Enclosed is a donation card that will enable you to make Indianapolis a great place for ALL of us to live.

392	3.3	a	Participants in the Youth Outcomes Educational Initiative identified three goals for all our youth to obtain: economic self-sufficiency, healthy family, social relationships, and involvement in the community.
393	3.0	a	Name Address City, ST Zip
394	3.3	a	A short time later, the Community Youth Mapping Project sent 55 young people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow up well: caring adults, safe places to go, and positive things to do.
395	3.2	a	One group of adults and one group of youth, through two very different processes, have arrived at the same conclusion; our community still has much to do if we are to help ALL of your youth successfully develop into the responsible, productive adults who will our community in the future.
396	3.3	a	It is our goal that every young person in Marion County have access to the programs and services that can best assist them in their growth toward a positive adulthood.
397	3.2	a	I will call you in a few weeks to discuss your level of interest.
398	3.22	a	Please consider joining together with your fellow citizens in support of the work of the Marion County Commission on Youth.

401	3.1	a	John Brandon Executive Director
402	3.0	a	As you begin that process this year, I would like to ask you to consider helping young people in Marion County toward more positive youth development by becoming a supporter of the Marion County Commission on Youth, Inc.
403	3.2	a	MCCOY Inc., originally founded as a government agency but re-organized in 1993 as an independent not-for-profit, is a county-wide youth services coordinating, planning, and convening agency.
404	3.2	a	Its purpose is to encourage collaboration and cooperation between the various agencies, programs, and systems that serve our community's youth.
405	3.2	a	Dear Bill:
406	3.4	a	This is the time of year when our thoughts turn to ways to do things differently, things that will make our lives better and improve the quality of our life.
407	2.88	a	The formation of The Community Academy, a pilot project directed at expelled students from local school systems, has come about as a result of MCCOY's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response to a pressing issue.
408	3.43	a	McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the inclusion of young people in both decision-making and program planning processes.
409	3.12	a	One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne, Indiana.
410	3.0	a	October 7, 1996
411	3.0	a	MCCOY was reorganized as an independent, not-for-profit agency, separate from local government.
412	3.0	a	McCoy has only one interest: the well being of Marion County's young people.
413	3.2	a	---- the co-ordination of youth leadership training and youth empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of neighborhood-based youth councils;
414	3.4	a	---- the promotion of youth employment opportunities;
415	3.0	a	---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding effective and efficient youth service delivery;
416	3.2	a	---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to neighborhoods which seek positive youth-adult relationships;
417	3.38	a	In the last several years, the business and corporate community has recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to the development of a competent workforce.
418	3.2	a	Youth who are supported and encouraged by both a family and a society that values Them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and contributing members of adult society.
419	2.73	a	While we have made significant inroads, there remains much to be done and it is clear that we cannot do it alone.
420	3.3	a	We seek the financial support of the Foundation to help us be successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people can grow and develop well.
421	3.0	a	Name Address City, ST Zip
422	3.43	a	In our fund raising efforts to date, we have received the support of local government, foundations, and corporations as well as the personal financial commitments of individual MCCOY Board members.
423	3.2	a	We believe there is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community as a whole.
424	3.44	a	Thanking you in advance for your support, we remain,
425	3.1	a	Sincerely,

457	3.1	a	If you have not supported Big Sisters in the past, please join me in doing so by completing and returning the enclosed pledge form.
458	3.0	a	Early adolescence is the most vulnerable age for youth.
459	3.4	a	But caring adults like you can reach out and help.
460	3.29	a	It's the perfect time to make a world of difference.
461	3.43	a	Sincerely,
462	3.1	a	When young people don't have that support, they need other resources for encouragement to guide them along the way.
463	2.9	a	Name Address City, State, Zip
464	3.33	a	Big Sisters helps bridge that gap by providing children with the resources they need -- Big Sisters volunteers.
465	3.5	a	Big Sisters are mentors and friends who empower girls to more fully reach their potential, experience life's opportunities and perhaps begin to dream.
466	3.0	a	Dear Name,
467	3.5	a	The relationships that are formed provide strong foundations from which healthy values and strong self-confidence can grow, helping youth become strong, independent adults of tomorrow.
468	2.1	a	It's tough growing up today.
469	3.0	a	This is an impressive number; but for each girl served, more are left unserved.
470	3.6	a	This is positive proof that Big Sisters one-to-one mentoring program helps change lives.
471	3.57	a	Today, we are offering you the opportunity to help change a life.
472	3.4	a	By contributing $1,000 you can support one match for one year.

479	3.11	a	Sincerely,

481	3.3	a	Dear Friend:

485	3.2	a	The results of an 18-month study completed by Public/Private Ventures showed that children participating in one-to-one Big Sister and Big Brother matches for just one year, reduced first time drug use by 46%; lowered school absenteeism by 52%; cut aggressive behavior by 33%; enhanced school performance; and improved relations with family and friends.
486	3.0	a	A recent study by Public/Private Ventures (PPV) showed that girls who had a Big Sister for just one year:
487	3.2	a	Dear Mr. Philanthropy,
488	3.7	a	reduced first-time drug use by 46%
489	3.3	a	lowered school absenteeism by 52%
490	3.2	a	cut violent behavior by 33%
491	3.5	a	enhanced school performance showed improved peer and family relationships

494	3.3	a	"""I was matched with my Big Sister in June of 1992."
495	3.6	a	Since then, she and I have grown very close and I have been able to experience lots of new things.
496	3.8	a	Not only did I have a lot of fun with my Big Sister, but I learned a lot from her too.
497	2.9	a	August 10, 1999
498	3.7	a	I have become more open-minded, more responsible, and, most importantly, I have gained a lot more self-confidence.
499	4.0	a	I am very thankful to the Big Sisters program for allowing me this very special opportunity.
500	3.33	a	In 1998, Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many programs.
501	2.9	a	But the need is still great.
502	3.0	a	Do not sit this one out.
503	3.0	a	You are an important part in making sure these young people are matched with caring adult mentors.
504	3.0	a	Will you make a financial gift to Big Sisters in 1999 that will ensure that more young people receive the guidance they need, that more young people stay in school, stay off drugs and make good choices?
505	2.83	a	Do not play it safe.
506	3.14	a	It will also be used to help maintain the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships, including volunteer orientation and training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff.
507	3.29	a	Understand the world and change it where it needs to be changed...
508	3.5	a	This year your gift can go farther!
509	3.1	a	Gifts of $100 or more will be matched thanks to a special 25th Anniversary $100,000 Challenge Grant and will be placed in the Growth For Girls Fund.
510	3.2	a	This fund will support the goal of having 550 mentoring relationships by the end of 1999 and 1,200 by the end of 2004.

520	2.5	a	We often hear about economic poverty, but what some of these young people are growing up with is emotional poverty-they have often given up on hope and the possibility of a successful future.
521	3.2	a	With your help, we can change that.

541	2.6	a	Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended, which some say have thwarted the country's ability to recover from the devastation of the bombing campaign.
542	2.22	a	The Persian Gulf War destroyed much of the country's medical infrastructure, according to a report by the World Health Organization.
543	2.9	a	The Iraqi government has agreed to let U.S. Rep. Tony Hall visit the country next week to assess a humanitarian crisis that has festered since the Gulf War of 1990, Hall's office said Monday.
544	2.5	a	In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population existed in a state of ``semi starvation.''
545	3.0	a	Hall will be only the second member of Congress to travel in Iraq since the war, according to Hall's office.
546	2.6	a	The Iraqi government blames the embargo for the malnutrition, infant mortality and other hardships.
547	2.82	a	The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction and the means to produce them.
548	2.5	a	Iraq says it has done so and has barred inspectors since late 1998.
549	3.1	a	At least one other congressman has visited Iraq.
550	3.0	a	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson went to Baghdad in 1995 while a representative for New Mexico.
551	2.86	a	Hall, an Ohio Democrat and one of very few U.S. congressmen to visit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait, is scheduled to embark Sunday the 12-hour overland trip to the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.

554	2.2	a	During his four days in Iraq, Hall said he wanted to investigate reports from relief agencies that a quarter of Iraqi children may be suffering from chronic malnutrition.
555	2.9	a	U.S. Representative Tony Hall arrived in Jordan on Saturday en route to Iraq, where he is expected to look into the plight of Iraqis after nearly 10 years of U.N. trade sanctions.
556	3.0	a	He said he would pay particular attention to what happens to food and medicine entering the country under the U.N. oil-for-food program.
557	2.7	a	"If supplies are not reaching the people who need them, Hall said, he wanted to find out whether the United Nations or relief agencies needed to handle things differently, or whether ""Iraq needs to get out of the way and let us do the job."""

559	2.57	a	Iraq says the United States and Britain hold up delivery of needed supplies, using their clout in the United Nations.
560	3.1	a	A U.S. lawmaker assessing the impact of U.N. sanctions on Iraq said Wednesday it is important not only to force Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction but also to do more to ease the hardships on ordinary Iraqis.
561	2.9	a	The U.S. government says it wants to ensure that Iraq is not buying items that appear to be humanitarian in nature but that could be used for making weapons.
562	2.89	a	Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, did not call for a lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, but said the United Nations should make sure that sanctions do not hurt innocent Iraqis.

568	3.1	a	On Thursday, Powell and representatives of the nations of the Asian group, including Indonesia, are expected to sign a declaration promising cooperation to prevent terrorism by sharing information, blocking funds, tightening borders and making it hard to use forged travel papers.
569	2.7	a	"""We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes, which continue to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by the international community,"""
570	2.89	a	"""We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes, which continue to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by the international community,"" the ministers said in a communique on Tuesday."
571	3.0	a	Powell is among the representatives from 13 nations outside Southeast Asia, including China, Japan and Russia, that are taking part in the annual meeting of the group's regional forum.
572	2.9	a	Terrorism dominates the agenda, though the possibility of a meeting here between Powell and his North Korean counterpart, Paek Nam Sun, has generated the most news.
573	3.0	a	It would be the highest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since President Bush took office.
574	3.0	a	Powell heads to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, late on Thursday before finishing a weeklong trip through the region in the Philippines on Saturday.
575	2.9	a	The committee's action comes six months after federal prosecutors ended a lengthy criminal investigation into Torricelli's activities without filing criminal charges.
576	3.2	a	"He said that when he arrives in Jakarta, he will have ""some ideas and some initiatives"" to present to President Megawati Sukarnoputri."
577	3.0	a	"""some ideas and some initiatives"""
578	2.86	a	Indonesia is already receiving $400,000 in the current fiscal year for civilian training programs and is to receive a like amount next year; and the United States expects to provide an additional $16 million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism.
579	3.0	a	"At the same time, the Pentagon is reviewing how to allocate another $17 million in ""counterterrorism fellowships,"" some of which could go to Indonesia."
580	2.9	a	"""counterterrorism fellowships,"""
581	3.11	a	But a senior State Department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and Congress are pushing for more direct military cooperation, which would require congressional approval.
582	3.0	a	"""I think they recognize the danger that we all face and I think they have been cooperating more fully with us as time goes by, and I'm quite sure that Mrs. Megawati is committed to this cause,"" Powell said in Singapore."
583	2.7	a	Powell contended that it was not inconsistent to want to foster cooperation even with an organization like the Indonesian military, which has a history of human rights abuses.
584	3.1	a	"""If you get young officers, expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political institution, such as the United States, then that rubs off on them,"""
585	2.82	a	"""If you get young officers, expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political institution, such as the United States, then that rubs off on them,"" he said."
586	3.0	a	In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981.
587	3.2	a	The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities.
588	2.75	a	The ethics panel, to which evidence from the criminal case was forwarded, concluded its review just as Torricelli is gearing up his campaign for re-election against the Republican candidate, Douglas R. Forrester.
589	2.67	a	His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized.
590	2.7	a	The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial.

594	3.3	a	Microsoft plans to announce on Wednesday a partnership with AT&T Wireless Services to offer software for wireless devices and services, a person close to the talks said Tuesday night.
595	2.9	a	The deal would be part of Microsoft's drive to sign up wireless carriers to use its so-called smart phone software -- a pared-down version of the Windows operating system -- and services that Microsoft is developing as part of its .Net Internet strategy.
596	2.9	a	Neither Microsoft nor AT&T Wireless would comment.
597	3.4	a	But Microsoft's potential advantage, analysts say, is its ability to link its cell phone software to its desktop PC software, a Microsoft stronghold.
598	2.9	a	After months in which polls showed Torricelli well ahead of his relatively unknown Republican rival, the contest has narrowed in recent weeks.
599	3.0	a	In recent months, Microsoft has announced partnerships with wireless carriers like Verizon and Sprint PCS.
600	2.5	a	Floyd did not produce the kind of offense the Expos expected from him, so Omar Minaya, the Expos' aggressive rookie general manager, turned around and sent him to the Red Sox in exchange two South Korean pitchers and a player yet to be named.

604	3.1	a	Colon has won four of five decisions for the Expos, but Floyd batted only .208 for them while hitting three home runs, including one Tuesday night, and driving in four runs.
605	3.0	a	With the Marlins Floyd bated .287, hit 18 home runs and drove in 57 runs.
606	3.0	a	The Expos, who had a 46-41 record when they made their first Floyd deal, had only a 7-12 record with him on the team, dropping from 9 1/2 games behind Atlanta in the National League East to as many as 16 games back.
607	2.9	a	It was the first time that the Senate Ethics Committee had voted to take action against a senator since 1995, when it recommended that Bob Packwood, an Oregon Republican, be expelled on the ground of sexual and official misconduct.
608	3.0	a	Floyd can be a free agent after this season, and Minaya decided it would be more prudent to trade him and get value in return than have to settle for a draft choice or two as compensation when he signed with another team as a free agent.
609	3.1	a	The Expos acquired Sun Woo-kim and Seung Jun-song.
610	3.0	a	Kim, 24, is a right-handed pitcher from Seoul.
611	3.09	a	The Red Sox signed him in 1997.

615	3.5	a	But as the day wore on, the Red Sox tried harder and by Tuesday night were able to get the player they wanted for their lineup.
616	2.5	a	With the barrage of crack cocaine-connected killings in the 1980s came the realization that young people were too often full-fledged players in the violence.
617	3.22	a	That was more evident here than in any other city, said George Starke, who after his career as an offensive tackle with the Washington Redskins from 1973 to 1984 stuck around and decided to make this place more than his home.
618	2.3	a	"""There was death in D.C. throughout the '80s and into the '90s, and there was death everywhere,"""

622	3.1	a	And from the beginning I could see that it was all about jobs.
623	3.0	a	"I could see that you needed the private sector involved."""
624	2.62	a	Starke could see that in many instances these were cases of lost dignity.
625	2.7	a	"""I had a young man come up to me three years ago and say, 'Mr. Starke, I'm tired of going to bed at night with a Tech-9 gun under my pillow."""
626	2.8	a	Packwood later resigned.
627	2.44	a	And Starke was tired of seeing Washington and its young people suffer a black eye.
628	3.1	a	So, after six years of planning, he opened the Excel Institute Automotive Program, a two-year school that gives people a chance at a new life as an auto technician or in another job related to the field.
629	3.5	a	The school, now in its third year, has been so successful that it recently received a $2 million grant from Congress.
630	3.6	a	The program is being copied by other cities and has attracted students from all walks of life, ages 16 to 68.
631	3.18	a	The program is coordinated with the University of the District of Columbia.
632	3.0	a	Students learn automotive intricacies and can earn a a high school equivalency diploma.
633	3.63	a	Starke, 54, played in two Super Bowls and won one.
634	3.0	a	He played for George Allen, Jack Pardee and Joe Gibbs.
635	2.86	a	In 1973, he was young enough to be a part of the Redskins' Over the Hill Gang, and in 1981 he was old enough to be one of the team's original Hogs.
636	3.14	a	He was recently named one of the 70 greatest Redskins.
637	3.22	a	"He earned a physics degree from Columbia, became a Redskin, studied drama, worked in sports broadcasting, opened a Washington restaurant and built his own home here when he thought he might become a developer, ""just so I could know how the business worked from the ground up,"" he said."
638	3.0	a	"""just so I could know how the business worked from the ground up,"""
639	3.12	a	In 1992 he sold it to begin work on the Excel Institute, putting up $300,000 to get things started.
640	2.56	a	"""I saw a lot of kids and young men out there with no dads and no structure who couldn't read and some of them were beginning to realize that there is no growing old as a crack dealer -- you either die or go to jail,"""

642	2.9	a	"""My experience in the automotive industry was there was a dire shortage of auto technicians not only in America but internationally."""
643	3.3	a	So, Starke matched a problem with a problem and found a solution.

685	3.0	a	In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996.
686	3.0	a	During nearly seven hours of sworn testimony last week before the members and staff of the ethics panel, Torricelli said that he had not taken any gifts from Chang, and that what items he had accepted from the businessman he had later paid Chang for, one person familiar with his account said.

729	2.6	a	Your acceptance on loan from Mr. Chang of bronze statues (eagle and bronco buster) for display in your Senate office under your office's policy of accepting the loan of home state artwork was not consistent with Senate rules governing such loans, evidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of due regard for the Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rule (35) and, consequently, a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate rules.
730	2.91	a	"In its letter, which was signed by all six members, the panel wrote that it was ""troubled by incongruities, inconsistencies and conflicts, particularly concerning actions taken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to Chang."""
731	2.67	a	Your failure to act to prevent the acceptance of or to pay for gifts of earrings from Mr. Chang to individuals (your sister, an employee and a friend) in your home at Christmas on the mistaken belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances, evidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rule (35) and, consequently, a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate Rule 34.
732	2.6	a	Continuation of a personal and official relationship with Mr. Chang under circumstances where you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself, in part through a pattern of attempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over a period of several years when you and your Senate Office were taking official actions of benefit to Mr. Chang (contacting United States Government officials, writing letters to foreign government officials and involving Mr. Chang of his representatives in situations where you were meeting with officials of foreign governments) evidenced poor judgment.
733	2.8	a	The committee has also considered that the principal source of the allegations against you is David Chang, a witness whose credibility has been called into question by the Department of Justice, a United States district judge and his own conduct.
734	2.6	a	In court documents, the government noted that Chang could not be trusted.
735	2.9	a	On May 23, 2002, Mr. Chang was convicted of attempting to corruptly persuade a witness to give false testimony, a conspiracy to violate the federal election law and four violations of the federal election law.
736	2.78	a	After evaluating the extensive body of evidence before it and your testimony, the committee is troubled by incongruities, inconsistencies and conflicts, particularly concerning actions taken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to Mr. Chang.
737	2.4	a	Therefore, the committee . . . expresses its determination that your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules (and related statutes) and created at least the appearance of impropriety, and you are hereby severely admonished.
738	2.9	a	Further, the committee notes section 1(c)(1) of the Senate Gift Rule (35) concerning anything which is paid for at market value or returned . . . as well as your commitment to pay for any item which the committee might conclude were in violation of the rules, and has further concluded that you must pay Chang an amount sufficient to bring the total to fair market retail value of the TV and CD player, as well as the fair market retail value of the earrings given to the three individuals at your home, with appropriate interest.
739	3.3	a	The committee understands that you have previously delivered the bronze statues to the Department of Justice, from whence they should be returned to Chang.

741	3.0	a	This 30-second commercial is the first in H. Carl McCall's campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor and will be broadcast upstate in major broadcast markets, and on cable in New York City, starting today.
742	3.18	a	"The words ""His resume is an American dream,"" a quotation from Time magazine, appear on the screen."
743	3.3	a	"""His resume is an American dream,"""
744	3.1	a	A series of snapshots and images are then a visual resume for McCall.
745	3.1	a	They show him as an Army lieutenant, at his swearing-in as a state senator, as ambassador to the United Nations, surrounded by children as New York City school board president, and at other jobs, leading up to his current position, state comptroller.
746	3.0	a	A photograph of the candidate standing in his Army uniform next to his mother is shown, then the advertisement shifts to McCall talking about education, while images of the candidate looking at a computer screen with a small child and of him surrounded by children appear.
747	3.0	a	"The action then shifts to him in an office, speaking to the camera, as the words ""Experience."
748	3.5	a	"""Experience. Excellence. Carl McCall"""

753	3.4	a	"""I grew up poor with a single mother. She said education's a sledgehammer. It can open doors to opportunity. That's what education did for me. As governor, I'll make sure that every kid in New York has the same opportunity I had, to get a good education."""

756	3.3	a	"As governor, I'll make sure that every kid in New York has the same opportunity I had, to get a good education."""
757	2.86	a	This advertisement is long on introductions and short on claims of merit.
758	3.0	a	Thus, most of the facts presented are a matter of record.
759	3.0	a	He had the title of ambassador when he was at the United Nations, but he was not the chief of the American mission.
760	3.0	a	As for the claim about his success as comptroller, where he controls the state pension funds, there is no disputing the funds' growth during his terms, but some critics say it had more to do with the buoyancy of the stock market in the 1990s than skilled management.
761	3.2	a	The advertisement attempts to make several points and reach several different constituencies.
762	3.0	a	For one, it counters the high name recognition of Andrew M. Cuomo, McCall's opponent, by offering voters a straightforward introduction to the candidate, emphasizing his long list of high-level jobs in both the public and private sector.
763	3.17	a	It also emphasizes leadership, an important campaign issue after Sept. 11.
764	2.5	a	The New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned the death sentence of Leslie Ann Nelson, a transsexual go-go dancer who killed a police officer and an investigator with an AK-47 rifle.
765	2.6	a	Nelson, 44, had been the only woman of 14 people on New Jersey's death row.
766	2.9	a	The state attorney general's office has not decided whether to seek the death penalty again, a spokesman, Peter Aseltine, said Tuesday.
767	2.7	a	The court upheld the sentence of another death row inmate, Robert O. Marshall, convicted of arranging the murder of his wife at a picnic area on the Garden State Parkway.
768	3.0	a	In its 5-to-0 decision in the Nelson case, the court showed continuing uneasiness with the death penalty, as it has done even since adopting a voluminous set of review procedures in 1999 to govern capital cases.
769	2.89	a	New Jersey has not had an execution since 1963.
770	2.8	a	Justice James R. Zazzali and Justice Virginia Long said in a separate opinion that in addition to the reasons given in the majority opinion, also written by Zazzali, they believed the death penalty would constitute cruel and unusual punishment because of Nelson's history of emotional disturbance.
771	2.43	a	Zazzali and Long had expressed similar reservations in June 2001 when the court overturned the death sentence of Thomas J. Koskovich, who was 18 when he killed two pizza deliverymen in an ambush.
772	3.1	a	The majority opinion Tuesday said the court would impose higher standards in capital cases when reviewing prosecutors' conduct and possibly ambiguous jury instructions.
773	2.88	a	While all five members of the majority found the instructions to the jury on weighing aggravating and mitigating factors to be confusing, two of those justices wrote in a partial dissent that the prosecutor's statements in his summation about the defense's expert witnesses were within the bounds of acceptable argument.
774	2.6	a	The committee did not confirm some of the most serious allegations, including Chang's claim that he gave Torricelli tens of thousands of dollars in cash.
775	3.0	a	Two of the court's members, Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz and Justice Peter G. Verniero, did not participate in the Nelson case because both are former attorneys general.
776	2.62	a	Nelson, born Glenn Nelson, had severe psychological problems and a history of reclusive behavior into adulthood, and was convicted on a weapons charge in 1988.
777	3.25	a	After undergoing sex change surgery in 1992, she pursued a career as an exotic dancer.
778	2.75	a	During a 14-hour standoff, she killed a patrolman and an investigator from the Camden County prosecutor's office.
779	2.4	a	She pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to death by a jury in 1997.
780	2.8	a	The Supreme Court overturned that sentence in July 1998, ruling that the prosecution had failed to disclose important information to the jury.
781	3.0	a	"The case was the subject of Joe McGinniss' best-selling book ""Blind Faith."""
782	3.1	a	"""Blind Faith."""
783	3.0	a	The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 31:
784	3.1	a	"The committee said it had weighed the fact that Torricelli's principal accuser in the case had been Chang, ""a witness whose credibility has been called into question by the Department of Justice, a United States District judge and his own conduct."""
785	3.0	a	President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt describes himself as America's leading Arab ally.
786	2.4	a	The latest example is Monday's re-sentencing of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a sociologist and human rights activist, to seven years in prison for his efforts to register voters, monitor elections and report attacks on Egypt's Coptic Christians.
787	3.0	a	Ibrahim, who holds dual United States and Egyptian citizenship, is 63 years old and ailing.
788	2.6	a	The verdict should be annulled, not just on humanitarian grounds but because his prosecution is an abrogation of the most basic standards of justice.
789	3.0	a	Like every other government institution, they hew closely to Mubarak's wishes.
790	3.0	a	That is especially true of the State Security Court that ruled in this case.
791	2.8	a	"""a witness whose credibility has been called into question by the Department of Justice, a United States District judge and his own conduct."""
792	2.8	a	Nor is it likely his sentence would have been reaffirmed if Mubarak believed that convicting an American citizen for promoting democracy and human rights might jeopardize his own standing with the Bush administration and the $2 billion annual American subsidy that keeps his government afloat.
793	3.33	a	That aid bonanza was granted to reward Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat, for signing a peace treaty with Israel.
794	2.4	a	Washington has never demanded good governance and democracy from Cairo in return.
795	3.2	a	In recent months President Bush has spoken of the need to promote democracy in the Arab world.
796	2.88	a	But so far he has pushed the point only with the Palestinians.
797	3.0	a	It is time to extend this policy to Egypt.
798	2.33	a	While hardly the worst example of dictatorship in the Middle East, Egypt is one of the saddest.
799	3.22	a	It is a country with a long and glorious history, a substantial middle class, a peace treaty with Israel and large quantities of American aid.
800	2.71	a	Under Mubarak it has squandered economic and diplomatic opportunities and relentlessly stifled political debate.
801	2.5	a	This is entirely insufficient.
802	2.78	a	In May, that judge sentenced sentenced Chang to 18 months' imprisonment for obstructing justice and making $53,700 in illegal campaign contributions to Torricelli's 1996 Senate campaign.
803	3.0	a	The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 31:
804	3.25	a	The governor, like Mayor Michael Bloomberg, now seems committed to creating a better mix of uses for ground zero, and a 24-hour community in Manhattan's downtown.
805	3.0	a	While rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding schedule slightly, it does not need to stall progress if the governor keeps the pressure on the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.
806	2.6	a	New York cannot afford to have a gaping hole that mocks the city and its process for rebuilding what was destroyed.
807	3.0	a	Renegotiating that issue with the World Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately.
808	3.0	a	Opening the process to other designers, both here and internationally, will help separate this urban plan from the ordinary.
809	3.0	a	The city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens underground, in particular with the transportation network.
810	3.2	a	At this point, planners have focused on short-term repair of PATH and subway lines, with medium-range proposals being shopped in Washington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines downtown.
811	2.9	a	"But at the time of Chang's sentencing, the judge, Alfred M. Wolin, also said the businessman had cooperated closely with federal investigators, providing them with information that was ""material and credible."""
812	3.0	a	Within the next few weeks the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.
813	2.8	a	and the Port Authority should offer some bigger ideas about how to connect the downtown area better to the rest of the region.
814	3.2	a	Lowering West Street alongside the World Trade Center site and building a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been popular with those reviewing the first six public proposals.
815	3.0	a	Pataki's recent remarks are a sign that he understands how central the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own political legacy.
816	3.12	a	Now he needs to follow through with action, to keep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with the best possible plan, not simply keeping the issue on hold until after this fall's election.
817	3.0	a	The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 31:
818	3.09	a	"President Bush has now unveiled his long-awaited ""Clear Skies"" proposal, which he promises will simplify and strengthen the Clean Air Act without crippling American industry."
819	2.8	a	Like Jeffords, the president calls for substantial reductions in three major pollutants -- the nitrogen oxides that produce smog, sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and mercury.
820	2.7	a	But he ignores emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas.
821	2.5	a	That is a huge omission.
822	3.0	a	Even for the pollutants he addresses, Bush's timetable is too leisurely.
823	3.1	a	He aims to reduce all three by 70 percent by 2018.
824	2.9	a	The Jeffords proposal would make the same sizable reductions by 2008.
825	2.8	a	Finally, the Bush proposal would roll back key provisions of the existing Clean Air Act that Jeffords would keep.
826	3.3	a	Bush argues that the regulatory mechanisms he has in mind for reaching Clear Skies' goals, chiefly a market-based emissions trading scheme, will be so effective that the need for many existing rules will disappear.
827	3.1	a	This page has long embraced emissions trading as an essential tool for reducing pollution at manageable cost.
828	2.75	a	But some regulations, aimed at specific regional problems that nationwide trading alone is unable to address, cannot lightly be abandoned.
829	2.9	a	Among these are rules governing emissions that limit visibility in the national parks, and rules governing pollution that drifts eastward from Midwestern power plants.
830	3.11	a	Indeed, Bush has already made clear his intention to roll back one of the most important of these regulations, a provision known as new source review that compels utilities to install modern pollution controls whenever they significantly upgrade older plants.
831	3.27	a	The 1970 Clean Air Act is a landmark statute, deserving of thoughtful improvement.
832	2.5	a	The Bush bill, as written, is not the way to get there.
833	2.9	a	In Torricelli's case, it acted without conducting a full investigation, saying the case had been exhaustively scrutinized by federal authorities.
834	2.6	a	A lawyer for Chang, Bradley D. Simon, said Tuesday night that he was disappointed that the ethics panel had confirmed only a handful of the gifts he said his client had given Torricelli, and that the panel did not deal with what he said were actions by Torricelli to thwart the federal investigation.
835	2.75	a	"""This matter was far more serious than what the committee found,"" Simon said."
836	2.9	a	According to two government officials involved in the inquiry, the Ethics Committee received a vast amount of information from federal investigators, some of it under a court order issued in March.
837	3.0	a	That information included witness statements, store receipts and other documents indicating that Chang had paid for expensive items given to Torricelli, his sister, one of his longtime aides, Roberta Stern, and one of Torricelli's former girlfriends, Judy D. Balaban.
838	2.89	a	The committee's letter did not mention Chang's reported gifts to Torricelli of an $8,100 Rolex watch, about a dozen Italian-made suits and a $3,816 antique grandfather clock.
839	2.88	a	Nor did it cite a $1,590 Oriental carpet that Chang gave to Torricelli's former wife, Susan Holloway Torricelli.
840	2.38	a	"""Your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules (and related statutes) and created at least the appearance of impropriety,"""
841	2.8	a	"But it said the senator had showed ""poor judgment"" by failing to reimburse him for the full market value of the gifts."
842	2.4	a	"""poor judgment"""
843	3.0	a	"""wholesale"""
844	2.7	a	The ethics panel also criticized Torricelli for taking two bronze statues on loan from Chang.
845	3.0	a	The statues, the existence of which had not been publicly known before, were displayed in Torricelli's Senate office.
846	3.1	a	Finally, the committee appeared to have discounted Torricelli's contention that he was not responsible for expensive earrings that Chang had given as Christmas gifts to his sister, Stern and Balaban.
847	2.9	a	"""that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances"""
848	2.62	a	According to a government official involved in the inquiry, the information reviewed by the Ethics Committee also included an analysis by federal investigators showing that during the period in which Chang claimed to have made numerous cash payments to Torricelli, the senator spent thousands of dollars more in cash than investigators could account for from his bank withdrawals and other known sources of income.
849	2.9	a	A spokeswoman for Torricelli, Debra DeShong, said he had fully accounted for all the money he had spent.
850	3.0	a	"""Senator Torricelli provided the committee with a full explanation of sources of income and any funds used for cash purposes,"" she said."
851	2.9	a	"Even after the ethics committee admonished Torricelli on Tuesday night, one of his most important political supporters, Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., continued to defend him, stating that the panel had found Chang ""a witness wholly without credibility."""
852	2.67	a	"""a witness wholly without credibility."""
853	3.0	a	"Moving quickly to make a campaign issue of the Senate letter, Bill Pascoe, Forrester's campaign manager, said the findings were evidence that Torricelli had undertaken an ""extensive campaign of misinformation and deceit,"" and called on him to release the sworn testimony he gave to the panel."
854	2.25	a	"""extensive campaign of misinformation and deceit,"""
855	3.11	a	"Pascoe said, ""Only then will New Jersey voters be able to decide Torricelli's fitness for office."""

857	3.11	a	U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived here on Tuesday night for meetings with fellow foreign ministers aimed at solidifying a second front, in Southeast Asia, in the campaign against global terrorism.
858	2.89	a	But he has had to balance that goal with longstanding concerns about human rights abuses in the region.
859	2.9	a	In meetings on Tuesday in Malaysia and Singapore before touching down in this oil-producing sultanate for two days of talks with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, Powell said he repeatedly raised the issue.
860	2.5	a	"The Senate Ethics Committee on Tuesday night ""severely admonished"" Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., saying he had violated Senate rules by accepting and failing to disclose expensive gifts from a former contributor to whom he repeatedly gave help."
861	3.2	a	"""We still believe strongly in human rights, and that everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights,"""
862	3.11	a	"""We still believe strongly in human rights, and that everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights,"" he said."
863	2.7	a	But at a news conference in Singapore, Powell hinted that the Bush administration was ready to discuss resuming military cooperation with Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation and a sometimes reluctant partner in the efforts to crack down on militant Islamic groups.

923	2.5	a	Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor's letter (only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request -- not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!)
924	1.7	a	"This booing by the crowd, not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article, shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to Littleton after children were being killed there -- and they effectively said ""Fuck you""."
925	2.6	a	To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics.
926	2.56	a	The rally took place on October 17, the shooting on February 29.
927	2.9	a	Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion:
928	2.7	a	"""Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas."
929	2.78	a	"It is brilliantly, if unethically, done."""
930	3.0	a	"As noted above, the ""from my cold dead hands"" part is simply Moore's way to introduce Heston."
931	3.0	a	"He certainly does not ""attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered"" and, as noted above, doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is."
932	2.9	a	"Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland, you write: ""There is no indication that [Heston] recognized Kayla Rolland's case."""
933	2.6	a	This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence.
934	3.0	a	This is one valid criticism, but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be; rather, it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore's fast pace editing.
935	3.1	a	His documentary is full of subtle humor, jaw-dropping dialogue and dark contrasts.
936	3.1	a	"The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there (as will become quite obvious), but simply to highlight the first mention of the name ""Kayla Rolland"" in the text, which is in this paragraph."
937	2.7	a	Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression.
938	3.0	a	It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website.
939	2.7	a	However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons:
940	3.0	a	"""before he came to Flint"""
941	3.0	a	In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March.
942	2.89	a	All in all, it is an accurate portrayal of America's gun and violence culture.
943	2.88	a	If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published?
944	3.0	a	"b) Why should Moore leave the words ""Clinton is on the Today Show"" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part?"
945	2.9	a	I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing.
946	2.8	a	"c) Both the ""soccer mom"" interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact."
947	2.4	a	"The camera lingers on Bush/Cheney posters, and the protestor is quoted as saying that ""we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland""."
948	2.9	a	"""we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland"""
949	2.8	a	It also raises questions about America's foreign policy of recent decades, questions which have been all but ignored by Moore's critics.
950	2.7	a	Why did Moore, the masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out?
951	2.5	a	"Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation's youngest school shooting months after the fact, but this sequence of ""Bowling"" is without doubt the most unfair to Heston."
952	2.7	a	"The claims of deliberate distortion don't hold up when viewing the whole scene, though -- as ""Hanlon's Razor"" states, one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence."
953	2.8	a	The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly.
954	3.0	a	"In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is ""full of lies""."
955	2.78	a	You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology, yet you have no problems changing it yourself.
956	3.0	a	"On your webpage, you state that ""Moore's resolution is questionable."
957	2.3	a	"After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston, where he is asked about Kayla Rolland (again, clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA's presence), then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch, entirely ignored by critics of the film, who also mentions Heston's presence as notable, and refers to the immediate reactions of ""people from all over America"", gun owners/groups who, according to him, reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children, much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti-spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating."
958	2.6	a	"""Moore's resolution is questionable."
959	3.0	a	After all, early in the movie he discards the possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence -- because Canadians like, and Japanese positively love, those.
960	2.9	a	This is all not mentioned by critics of Moore's movie, who claim to be objective.
961	2.8	a	"Perhaps the best example of the paranoia surrounding Moore's film is your sub-essay ""Is the end of the Heston interview itself faked?"
962	3.11	a	"""For all we can tell, Moore could have shouted 'Hey!' to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left."""
963	2.8	a	"Even if your ""re-enactment"" theory is true (and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion), this itself is not unethical, and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here, just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of the interview."
964	2.73	a	You use standard filmmaking technique as a basis to construct bizarre conspiracies which sound plausible to the gullible reader, without ever providing any evidence for the implicit or explicit claims of fraud and distortion.
965	2.8	a	6)Animated history of the US. Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film.
966	2.5	a	"But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote ""gun rights"" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish."
967	2.83	a	Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people?
968	2.73	a	I highly doubt it.
969	2.6	a	But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK.
970	2.37	a	This is the key message of this part of the animation, which is again being ignored by its critics.
971	2.6	a	7) Buell shooting in Flint.
972	2.5	a	"You write: ""Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before""."
973	2.57	a	"""Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before"""
974	2.2	a	This characterization of a six-year-old as a pencil-stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore's film warns against.
975	3.0	a	It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset.
976	2.3	a	The kid was a little bastard, and the parents were involved in drugs -- case closed.
977	2.88	a	But why do people deal with drugs?
978	3.5	a	Because it's so much fun to do so?
979	2.5	a	"It is equally well known that the so-called ""war on drugs"" begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population (both in relative and absolute numbers)."
980	2.5	a	In poor areas, the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort.
981	2.6	a	"But the real cause here are not the drugs themselves, but poverty and the ""war on drugs""."
982	2.44	a	This is a faulty generalization.
983	2.2	a	"Had the boy's mother not been shipped to a ""welfare to work"" program, she might at least have had some time to spend with her son."
984	3.11	a	Virtually every child psychologist knows that mother/child bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social abilities, the awareness of the consequences of one's actions, and the learning of conflict resolution by non-violent means.
985	2.7	a	Even the official quoted by Moore blames the welfare to work program, knowing full well that the drug issue is a red herring.
986	2.4	a	Once again, your emphasis on the little boy as a thug confirms Moore's (and Busch's) assertion that people wanted to hang the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real causes.
987	2.5	a	That's because while there is a so-called war on drugs, there is no war on poverty.
988	2.5	a	Poverty is frequently portrayed as natural, and the poor in America are seen by conservatives as VCR-owners who are just too lazy to work.
989	2.6	a	In reality, what Moore describes here is the most vivid example of what can only be called wage slavery I have ever seen, to the detriment of families.
990	3.0	a	"It is notable that the Wall Street Journal's reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours: It called Moore's claim ""preposterous""."
991	3.1	a	, probably the most comprehensive among many rebuttals of the Oscar-winning documentary.
992	2.37	a	How could he even think about blaming poverty and forced labor programs for anything bad that happens?
993	3.0	a	8) Taliban and American aid.
994	2.7	a	Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies.
995	3.0	a	Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage.
996	2.9	a	Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
997	2.86	a	Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal.
998	2.3	a	"There is a huge difference, for example, between playing a game like ""Quake"" and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now."
999	3.0	a	Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moore's website about the film.
1000	2.2	a	9) Gun homicides.
1001	2.6	a	His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data, his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources (and, as you correctly point out, he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries).
1002	2.8	a	A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncite.com website.
1003	2.71	a	Not surprisingly, guncite, too, compares data from different years -- as I know from personal experience, it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology.
1004	2.9	a	The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned, according to guncite, are: Japan: 0.02 per 100,000 (1994)England/Wales: 0.11 per 100,000 (1997)Germany: 0.22 per 100,000 (1994)Australia: 0.44 per 100,000 (1994)United States: 3.72 per 100,000 (1999)
1005	2.63	a	"Critics fail to credit Moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make -- concluding that gun ownership ""leads"" to violence."
1006	3.0	a	In fact, Moore mentions several counter-examples, and more such counter-examples can indeed be cited.
1007	2.5	a	It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence -- but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly.
1008	2.9	a	"It is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of John ""Mary"" Lott."
1009	3.0	a	"The gun control movement, on the other hand, distracts from the real causes of violence -- poverty, paranoia, the ""war on drugs"" and antisexuality."
1010	2.9	a	If these causes were addressed, gun ownership in the United States would not be a problem (but also unnecessary); just like it is in Switzerland.
1011	3.0	a	10) Canada ammunition purchase.
1012	3.0	a	You write: Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart.
1013	3.12	a	"He asks us to ""look at what I, a foreign citizen, was able to do at a local Canadian Wal-Mart."""
1014	3.0	a	He buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised.
1015	3.3	a	"""That's right. I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted, in Canada."
1016	2.6	a	Canadian officials have pointed out that the buy is faked or illegal.
1017	2.5	a	"Once again, you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and ""faking"" (a word which ""Canadian officials"" have never used; for such a distortion, Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics)."
1018	3.0	a	If Moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson, there is nothing fraudulent about that.
1019	2.78	a	His claim that it is possible to purchase ammunition in supermarkets is independent from that claim.
1020	2.71	a	11) Heston's allegedly implied racism.
1021	3.0	a	"If anything, it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with ""having a more mixed ethnicity""."
1022	2.36	a	Similarly, the main motivation for the crusades (beyond the promise of wealth) was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved.
1023	2.2	a	Heston's answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful.
1024	2.9	a	While this can in part be explained with his age and mental condition, if he is unable to defend the interests of the NRA, he should not be their spokesman.
1025	2.9	a	In this case, Hanlon's Razor can be applied to Heston -- he is probably not racist, but incompetent.
1026	2.67	a	If Heston makes himself look like a fool, that should hardly be blamed on Michael Moore.
1027	2.1	a	"""Bowling for Columbine is dishonest."
1028	2.44	a	None of this is true.
1029	3.2	a	What is true is that Bowling for Columbine is a diamond in the small world of big screen documentaries, one that shines brightly and illuminates an often misunderstood aspect of American culture.
1030	2.6	a	"It is not a flawless diamond -- the ""48 hours"" scene in particular suffers from bad editing, the statistics are suboptimal, and Heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves."
1031	3.1	a	Other than towards the NRA, the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions, and comes up with some thoughtful answers.
1032	1.9	a	Obviously, media propaganda can incite people to kill.
1033	3.0	a	Had Moore wanted to make a propaganda film, he would have used other material: photos from America's Emergency Rooms.
1034	3.5	a	Certainly, Moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the United States today, and his film fully deserved its Oscar.
1035	2.5	a	"The shrill (and remarkably unsuccessful) Internet campaign to ""revoke"" his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about the film's accuracy."
1036	2.9	a	Interactive fiction like video games, on the other hand, presents violence in a narrative context, which may very well desensitize participants to said violence, but no causative link has ever been proven.
1037	3.6	a	It is not only the highest grossing non-music documentary of all time, among the users of the largest Internet film database, IMDB, it is also the highest rated one.
1038	3.0	a	But perhaps the campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason.
1039	2.25	a	It is unlikely, however, that the unfair attacks against him will have much of an impact.
1040	2.89	a	"After all, the same kind of PR blitz was started against the previous record-holding documentary: ""Roger & Me"" by Michael Moore."
1041	2.8	a	"Moore's hypothesis (which apparently comes at least in part from the book ""Culture of Fear"" by Barry Glassner, also advertised on Moore's website) is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia, which itself can lead to violent acts."
1042	2.67	a	Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award.
1043	2.78	a	This is consistent with the kind of media-incited violence described above, and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence.
1044	2.75	a	It is no surprise, however, that US (and European) media do not question their own propaganda of fear.
1045	3.0	a	Moore's second hypothesis is that America's foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts, a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists.
1046	2.62	a	Children who grow up in war-torn regions are known for having similar views -- war is perceived as a normal part of existence, violence as a natural way to solve disputes.
1047	2.6	a	"In a weaker sense, the same message is projected to American children, who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another, but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how ""the enemies of freedom"" are punished."
1048	2.6	a	Moore's film was made before the dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV.
1049	2.4	a	Americans were gloating over this demented corpse show:
1050	2.9	a	"""They squealed like little piggies too, so you'll have to make do with 'oink, oink, squeeeeeeeallll' for their last words."
1051	3.5	a	'oink, oink, squeeeeeeeallll'
1052	3.0	a	That goes for your grandson Mustafa too, by the way.
1053	2.5	a	"Still think fucking with the U.S. was a good idea, Sammy?"""
1054	2.1	a	Mustafa was 14 years when he was killed.
1055	2.29	a	Americans cheer the killing of children, yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations.
1056	2.91	a	It is paradoxical notions like this one which Moore's film seeks to address.
1057	2.6	a	Your webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in Moore's movies.
1058	2.9	a	It is true that Moore's film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive, but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme.
1059	3.0	a	Let's look at some specific criticisms:
1060	3.0	a	"Critics have stated that this scene was ""staged"", but in the bank interview, the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time."
1061	3.0	a	It is also a licensed firearms dealer which can perform its own background checks.
1062	3.0	a	"In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, linked from your site, an employee claims that the gun would have been ""normally"" picked up at another dealer."
1063	3.0	a	Dear David Hardy,
1064	2.8	a	"It is not explained what ""normally"" is supposed to mean, but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film."
1065	2.75	a	This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes, but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore.
1066	3.25	a	It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary.
1067	2.71	a	"According to the same WSJ interview, ""Typically, you're looking at a week to 10 days waiting period."""
1068	2.9	a	This is plausible -- but entirely irrelevant for the movie, which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed.
1069	3.0	a	Moore's detractors have sometimes extended those 7-10 days to several weeks, contradicting the bank's own estimate.
1070	3.0	a	There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene.
1071	2.7	a	The bank does exactly what it advertises: It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account.
1072	3.0	a	2) The Lockheed-Martin interview.
1073	2.56	a	First, the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly.
1074	3.0	a	The dialogue goes as follows:
1075	2.8	a	"A defense of Michael Moore and ""Bowling for Columbine"""
1076	2.9	a	"""So you don't think our kids say to themselves, gee, dad goes off to the factory every day - he builds missiles."
1077	2.37	a	These are weapons of mass destruction.
1078	2.7	a	"What's the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School?"""
1079	2.6	a	"""I guess I don't see that specific connection because the missiles that you're talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us."""
1080	2.22	a	"In a time of simple-minded patriotism, loud, clear and dissenting voices like Mr. Moore's are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced, partially through well funded public relations campaigns, partially through conservative ""grass-roots"" propaganda."
1081	2.88	a	Moore is not from Colorado -- his question is generic, not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question.
1082	2.75	a	McCollum understands it this way -- otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized.
1083	2.7	a	However, critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollum's response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant.
1084	3.1	a	"In response to one Moore detractor, McCollum wrote: ""Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U.S., we make no weapons at the Littleton-area facility Moore visited."""
1085	2.9	a	Of course, critics have conveniently ignored the fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the US military, and that the company is the nation's largest military contractor.
1086	2.8	a	As Moore correctly points out, it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons, but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence -- children learn by imitating adults.
1087	3.0	a	Yes, Moore makes this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the LM plant -- but he makes no incorrect statement.
1088	2.8	a	It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication, but in doing so, they themselves have, unlike Moore, made many incorrect claims.
1089	3.0	a	3) Denver NRA meeting.
1090	2.62	a	Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted the victims of the Columbine tragedy by holding a rally in Denver shortly afterwards.
1091	2.82	a	"First, the ""from my cold, dead hands"" part: This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston."
1092	3.14	a	It is perhaps one of his most famous quotes, shown on national TV even here in Germany.
1093	3.3	a	It tells viewers: Aha, this is the person we are talking about.
1094	3.0	a	It is Moore's way to say: Viewers, meet Charlton Heston, gun nut extraordinaire.
1095	2.83	a	"The ""visual of a billboard and a narration"" is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together, when in reality, it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver."
1096	2.8	a	If you do have something better to do, though, by all means do it .
1097	2.5	a	Why is someone so young not having fun with friends on a Friday night.
1098	2.6	a	Granted grading papers is important, but no fun makes for a boring life.
1099	3.6	a	since, when I was your age I had fun playing with my adorable son and caring for another baby.
1100	3.0	a	You need to try to have a life outside your computer.
1101	3.1	a	I'd read Watchmen a short while before and appreciated its narrative complexity, but not being used to reading comics, hadn't registered all the technical tricks that the artist was using to achieve this.
1102	3.2	a	The post not only taught me something about the grammar of such images, but more importantly led to me realising that there is a grammar to look for in the first place.
1103	3.2	a	So thanks a lot for that one.
1104	3.0	a	Plus Justifying Comics as a Legitimate Object of Study Parts I & II.
1105	3.5	a	"I also liked ""Teaching the Overdetermined Image."
1106	3.4	a	Your takedown of Cashill and the whole Ayers-wrote-Dreams was excellent, and the Cruel_cruel_death post (you know what I'm talking about, right?
1107	2.9	a	Also, The Day in Actual Communist and Real Nazi History seems as relevant today as ever.
1108	3.08	a	Agree with the previous two comments.
1109	3.0	a	What happened to your post that appeared in my RSS reader yesterday?
1110	3.0	a	Would it be possible to arrange your posts into three 'parties', and give your many readers the opportunity to 'vote' for one of them, by 'secret ballot'?
1111	3.4	a	I feel your British readers would appreciate that.
1112	3.5	a	However, when I started looking through my archives, it occurred to me that my output this year defines me much more sharply than in years past.
1113	3.1	a	I can't believe I wrote all that last year.
1114	3.0	a	What do I mean?
1115	3.0	a	The posts I consider foundational to my current professional identity all seem to have been composed in 2009.
1116	2.91	a	Granted, the likelihood that I'm suffering from the identitarian equivalent of presentism is awfully high, but I honestly thought I'd written some of the posts from early 2009 in 2006 or so.
1117	3.0	a	It may also be that I remember the scene of their writing, which would have been in the old apartment, i.e. the place I barely remember ever having lived in anymore.
1118	2.5	a	"Because I've been grading all damn day and am as tired as a Swearengen of hearing other about the finished semesters of pretty much every other academic blogger, I thought that it might be best to avoid jealously lashing out and scribble a ""Best of Acephalous 2009"" post."
1119	3.6	a	I noted on Facebook that, from a statistical perspective, what makes baseball such an amazing sport is that you can watch it your entire life and still see, on a daily basis, something you’ve never seen before.
1120	3.1	a	The fact that I can verify vague memories of events that occurred twenty-five years ago astounds me in a way I sometimes forget the Internet is capable of doing.
1121	3.0	a	This realization is obviously not of world-historical importance, merely a reminder that this thing whose existence we take for granted daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to human memory.
1122	2.9	a	The fact that at some point in the future I can know who I rode in an elevator with on 28 December 2005 is less weird because I chose to write about riding in an elevator with Grimace .
1123	3.1	a	That I can access detailed information about events I have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely.
1124	3.0	a	Joe Sambito.
1125	4.3	a	Wow.
1126	2.1	a	I sometimes wish I could forget that Pendelton is the Braves hitting coach.
1127	3.0	a	Closest I came to that was watching Dale Murphy get tagged out at the plate on what would have been an inside-the-park slam.
1128	3.0	a	He pitched for the Astros before he came to the Mets, stayed for '85, then he pitched for the Red Sox against the Mets in '86 World Series.
1129	2.7	a	I remember him being ineffective, and as it turns out, he was .
1130	3.0	a	Now that I remember him, which I didn't before, I remember him as being the pitcher who'd pitched for 1) the team the Mets faced to get to the '86 Series and 2) the one they faced in it.
1131	3.4	a	Memory, as Gertrude Stein would say, is funny.
1132	2.6	a	What's really bothersome, though, is when you only remember things from your distant past.
1133	2.66	a	My grandpa was alert till the end, but when I last saw him at age 92 everything he wanted to talk about was 70 years in the past.
1134	2.9	a	The Internet occasionally reminds me of how different life is because of it.
1135	3.0	a	A guess, but perhaps your grandfather's life at 22 was more interesting than the ensuing 70 yrs.
1136	3.09	a	It’s a truism, I know, but it has the benefit of actually being true.
1137	3.1	a	You know what makes this post great?
1138	2.3	a	No stinking cricket.
1139	3.0	a	Yeah, I remember Sambito from the Astros (when the Braves were in the old NL West because it made sense to have a team 3,000 miles from most of their division rivals).
1140	3.1	a	Solid pitcher for a while.
1141	3.0	a	Apparently, he is a player's representative now.
1142	2.9	a	Prosthetic memory.
1143	3.1	a	I like to read about others watching baseball more than I like to watch baseball by a factor of nine.
1144	3.1	a	Having given up on watching the actual sport, mention of baseball now only sparks memories of The Old Man and the Sea and the old time baseball writers.
1145	3.4	a	In this case, the something in question was watching the wonderfully named Angel Pagan hit an inside-the-park home run and initiate a triple play in the same game.
1146	3.1	a	It is true that at the end of time, the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers, as they had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing, but horrendous to watch in person.
1147	2.9	a	Plus, they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes.
1148	2.5	a	nota bene: An overdue library book is a crime against Humanities.
1149	2.9	a	John Emerson responded with some humbug about it not being an inside-the-park grand slam, which made me remember that I had seen an inside-the-park grand slam at some time in the remote past.
1150	3.5	a	I remember being six or seven years old and watching the Mets play the Cardinals in an afternoon game at Shea Stadium, and thanks to the miracle of the Internet, I can definitively say that at approximately 4:30 p.m. on 9 June 1985 , I watched Terry Pendleton hit an inside-the-park grand slam off Joe Sambito in a game the Cardinals would go on to win handily.
1151	3.0	a	Diagram of the polarization-opponent unit described by Lambrinos, et al (2000).
1152	3.0	a	The e-vector (heading) returned from the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes (1, 2) follows a cos2-function.
1153	3.0	a	Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae, and to mimic this, Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting “stalks” with which to both interact with other ants (who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae) and take in chemical information.
1154	3.0	a	These stalks will need to have receptors to measure the n-alkene levels present in another ant’s cuticular hydrocarbons, which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmate’s current task, perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun, causing a different ratio of n-alkanes to n-alkenes and the presence of branched n-alkanes in the hydrocarbon profile (Wagner, et al, 2001, as cited in Gordon & Greene, 2003).
1155	3.25	a	Such a robot would allow for both long-term studies of ant-robot interactions and studies of task-switching in the robots.
1156	3.14	a	Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity: foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns (Gordon, 2002), and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest (Gordon & Greene, 2003; Greene & Gordon, 2007).
1157	2.82	a	Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way, since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species (Gordon, 35).
1158	3.0	a	For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone.
1159	3.0	a	All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks, with four of each type of receptor per stalk.
1160	3.0	a	This technique, described by Ishida, et al (2001), has been shown to improve the chemical plume-tracking abilities of robots.
1161	3.0	a	The wires will lead back down through the stalk to the on-board PC.
1162	3.5	a	Finally, Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object.
1163	3.1	a	These sensors will be of the type patented by Peterson, et al (Patent #4,492,949), and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage.
1164	3.0	a	These will correspond to the muscles of the ant’s mandibles, which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects.
1165	3.1	a	A table of the sensors and their relation to the ant’s sensory system is provided below.
1166	3.0	a	Table of sensors and their relations to the ant.
1167	3.0	a	The red harvester ant lives in hot, dry deserts, building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain.
1168	3.1	a	The ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds, many of which do not grow in the desert (Gordon, 54), where only a few varieties of small shrubs, small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow (Gordon, 51).
1169	3.0	a	Introduction
1170	3.0	a	Motors
1171	3.1	a	Antie’s motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants.
1172	3.0	a	There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs.
1173	3.0	a	Two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers, emulating the grasping power of the ant’s mandibles.
1174	3.2	a	A third motor will lift and lower the grippers, allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head.
1175	3.0	a	Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs.
1176	3.0	a	These will be located in different places: the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie, corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths, while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt.
1177	3.11	a	Antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task, on the assumption that its time in the sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants.
1178	3.0	a	Other insects and creatures, including other species of ants, are present in the desert, but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals (Gordon, 7-11).
1179	3.0	a	The Behavior
1180	3.0	a	Antie will have a hybrid software architecture: a subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors, but many sub-behaviors will operate on a schema basis.
1181	3.1	a	Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible, and where appropriate, different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked.
1182	3.0	a	Common Behaviors
1183	3.11	a	To ease Antie’s on-board memory requirements and processing capabilities (and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand), I propose a few global variables and subroutines.
1184	3.0	a	The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode, and are compiled here for ease of reference:
1185	3.0	a	Background
1186	3.0	a	Because of this, I will ignore other ant species in the design of Antie, and will not create a fighting behavior.
1187	3.0	a	Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism, procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside, in-nest navigation, an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into, object identification and gripping, a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following, and the identification of other ants.
1188	3.1	a	Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years.
1189	3.0	a	For a simple start, the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed.
1190	3.0	a	The Ant & the Robot
1191	2.9	a	Ants of this species are of two types: breeding ants (queens and drones) and sterile female workers.
1192	3.0	a	In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside, Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading, and also how far from the nest it is at its current location.
1193	3.0	a	The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos, et al.
1194	3.0	a	Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest, and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance.
1195	3.0	a	Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal, as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season, which occurs but once per year.
1196	3.0	a	To exit, Antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight, and to get deeper, Antie will seek a lower temperature.
1197	3.0	a	The code may look something like this:
1198	3.0	a	The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories: brood care, nest maintenance, patrolling and foraging.
1199	3.0	a	This void function will be called nestEnter(), and will take in no inputs.
1200	3.0	a	To avoid bumping into things (including other ants), Antie be provided with an escape function.
1201	3.0	a	Each of Antie’s eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount, and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction.
1202	3.0	a	Regardless, this will be a very simple function.
1203	3.0	a	I will include one example:
1204	3.09	a	Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie’s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it, this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds.
1205	3.0	a	Before picking objects up, however, Antie will need to identify them.
1206	3.1	a	This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated.
1207	3.0	a	Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell.
1208	3.0	a	The code may look something like this:
1209	3.0	a	Once the object has been identified, Antie may grip it and lift it.
1210	3.0	a	A simple void function grip() taking in no inputs will tighten the grippers until a certain threshold of pressure is reached, at which point the grippers will be lifted for carrying.
1211	3.0	a	A void function release() will perform this same action in reverse.
1212	3.1	a	Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails: it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers, and localize the source of food-odors and midden-odors.
1213	3.0	a	Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on “antennae” stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past (Webb, 1998), regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones.
1214	3.0	a	As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing, a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from Antie’s four sensors on each stalk.
1215	3.0	a	The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a “left_IP” or “right_IP.”
1216	3.0	a	Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book “Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology,” as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell, et al (2003) to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models.
1217	3.0	a	Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces, I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine.
1218	3.0	a	Patrolling and foraging, too, occur for the most part outside of the nest, and have therefore been studied extensively (ex., Schafer, et al, 2006; Gordon, et al, 2002; Gordon, 2002; Gordon, 1987).
1219	2.6	a	Unfortunately, as of yet, no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds, and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society.
1220	2.9	a	For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode, I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow(), findFood(), and findMidden().
1221	3.1	a	The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants.
1222	3.0	a	As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with non-nestmates, Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest.
1223	3.0	a	Proposal for a Red Harvester Ant Robot: Colony Infiltration and Task Switching
1224	3.0	a	Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the n-alkene levels.
1225	3.0	a	The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this:
1226	3.0	a	Using these basic common behaviors, more complex behaviors may be coded.
1227	3.1	a	Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan, but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony (Gordon, 1996).
1228	3.09	a	Younger ants work more inside the nest, and older ants work more outside the nest.
1229	3.3	a	As a result, I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in.
1230	3.14	a	The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior.
1231	2.9	a	It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise, and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52­­­oC, at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest.
1232	3.0	a	A program encoding this behavior might look like this:
1233	2.88	a	These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems.
1234	3.0	a	The second behavior, patrolling, involves two sub-behaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling.
1235	3.14	a	Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest, roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes, and reentering the nest.
1236	3.0	a	This behavior will be implemented in two parts, with a task-switching algorithm based on age.
1237	2.88	a	Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005).
1238	2.88	a	In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34).
1239	3.0	a	Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory, though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests’ territories (Gordon, 57-60).
1240	3.0	a	In the case of midden work, Antie must be able to identify garbage, grasp it, carry it out of the nest, and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum (or until stimulated to switch behaviors).
1241	3.1	a	To control for this behavior, Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones.
1242	3.0	a	This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day, even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths (Gordon, 45).
1243	3.0	a	The code may look something like this:
1244	3.0	a	Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling.
1245	3.1	a	Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again.
1246	3.0	a	Trail patrollers will go much further, until food sources are found, and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow.
1247	3.0	a	An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound, presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit.
1248	3.1	a	A general site of food is all that the patroller need find; the foragers will dig through the sand for the food.
1249	3.0	a	Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this (note that part is on a schema basis):
1250	3.0	a	Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers’ cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers, who may then, upon smelling the returning patroller, be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest.
1251	3.0	a	The final behavior, foraging, will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R.
1252	3.0	a	Andrew Russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume.
1253	3.0	a	This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds, and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest.
1254	3.0	a	This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them.
1255	3.0	a	It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter-clockwise.
1256	3.0	a	The code for this, adapted from Russell’s paper, might look like this:
1257	3.0	a	Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest, even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path (Gordon, 47).
1258	3.0	a	To address this, a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon.
1259	2.9	a	Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work.
1260	3.0	a	To remind the reader, this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task-switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling.
1261	3.2	a	The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers’ returns with great accuracy by Schafer, et al (2006), and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers (Gordon, 2002).
1262	2.89	a	Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler.
1263	3.0	a	This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow (Gordon, 33-34; Holldobler et al, 1990, as cited in Webb, 1998).
1264	3.0	a	According to Schafer’s, et al. model of forager activation, every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit, a fraction (modeled at 0.0035) of inactive foragers joins the queue.
1265	2.88	a	For the purposes of modeling Antie, I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent, irreversible and partly a function of age, with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers.
1266	3.11	a	The code to model this task-switching might look something like this:
1267	3.0	a	Conclusion
1268	3.2	a	Antie will be a fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their task-switching thresholds, but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary.
1269	3.0	a	In addition to following these trails to the food, foragers must also be able to identify food, grasp it and carry it back to the nest.
1270	3.0	a	Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers, and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms, such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance.
1271	3.0	a	REFERENCES
1272	3.0	a	Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks (as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task), walk, navigate both within and outside of the nest, and of course switch tasks at appropriate times.
1273	3.1	a	Extensive research has been done on the interactions of social insects such as honeybees, ants and cockroaches, and in fact robots have passed undetected in cockroach society performing single simple behaviors already (Halloy et al, 2007).
1274	2.9	a	The Agent
1275	3.2	a	Antie will be implemented on a tiny Road Warrior robotic system.
1276	3.0	a	Behaviors will be coded in Interactive C, for which some pseudocode is included.
1277	3.0	a	Sensors will include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors.
1278	3.11	a	A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs.
1279	3.11	a	Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging.
1280	3.11	a	These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted.
1281	3.0	a	For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day.
1282	3.0	a	A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached.
1283	3.0	a	In order to inform itself about its environment, Antie will need a number of sensors.
1284	3.09	a	In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible, these sensors include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors and sonar, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae.
1285	3.0	a	On its front grippers, Antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure.
1286	3.0	a	The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way, and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius.
1287	3.12	a	These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night: the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night (Gordon, 5).
1288	2.9	a	No robot has yet been constructed, however, that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus; nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them.
1289	3.0	a	The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation, and the bump sensors will, when depressed, also initiate the escape function.
1290	3.1	a	The sonar will correspond to the ant’s limited optical object detection ability, and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions.
1291	3.1	a	The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and -45 degrees from the center front of Antie, respectively, that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern.
1292	2.9	a	These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants’ eyes sensitive to polarized light, and research has shown that many insects, including ants, do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer (Labhart, et al, 2002).
1293	3.0	a	Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos, Moller, Labhart, Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000, consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers.
1294	3.0	a	The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie, who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest: Upon each exit from the nest, Antie will take a single 360o scan of the sky, and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later.

1314	2.8	a	We completely reject the idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force, because brute force radicalizes the moderates, and they then join the terrorists.
1315	2.8	a	Brute force has failed in Palestine, and it is failing in Iraq.
1316	2.8	a	"We try to be even-handed in opposing all terrorism, although we recognize that the greatest terrorist threat in the world today comes from radical Muslims who falsely believe that Allah approves of their criminal behavior against Israel, The United States, Russia, India, the Philippines, Australia, and others whom they falsely believe to be ""waging war against Allah."
1317	2.6	a	"And the second-greatest terrorist threat comes from several countries, mainly Israel, who sometimes resort to terrorism themselves, claiming ""self-defense,"" as they desperately try to prevent further attacks by radical Muslims."
1318	2.7	a	In all of these cases above, if the radical Muslims would cease their attacks, all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end.
1319	2.3	a	The number and severity of terrorist attacks worldwide has increased dramatically, as has the number of active terrorists.
1320	2.7	a	The moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and erroneous.
1321	2.2	a	They need to be identified and attacked.
1322	2.9	a	If the terrorist loses faith in the righteousness of his acts, he is less likely to perform them.
1323	2.6	a	"EXAMPLE 1: ""Terrorists Offend Allah."""
1324	1.9	a	"EXAMPLE 2: ""Terrorist Murderers Insult Allah, Bring Shame To Islam"""
1325	2.9	a	In every case of terrorism, we will find some kind of legitimate underlying grievance.
1326	3.1	a	If we eliminate the legitimate grievances, we have eliminated much of the motivation.
1327	2.7	a	"Is this ""negotiating with terrorists"" or ""trying to appease the terrorists,"" as some Israeli/NeoCons would try to say?"
1328	3.1	a	It is simply recognizing the realities of human motivation, right or wrong.
1329	2.6	a	To deny reality, as the Israeli/NeoCons do, is to invite disaster, as they have done.
1330	4.0	a	Blessings to you.
1331	2.9	a	Before 9/11, terrorism was confined to a small number of extremist individuals, loosely linked by radical Islam and hatred of Israel and its sole supporter, the USA.
1332	2.7	a	May God help us all.
1333	3.73	a	Blessings to you.
1334	2.5	a	May God help us all.

1336	3.18	a	By Rev. Bill McGinnis , Director - LoveAllPeople.org
1337	2.5	a	Now, many more moderate Muslims have become radicalized, world-wide, willing to kill innocent civilians in order to achieve their purposes.
1338	2.36	a	And the serious targets have expanded to include civilians in Russia, India, Maylasia, the Philippines, Spain, and elsewhere, as well as Israel and its sole supporter, the United States.
1339	2.7	a	Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as “quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,”
1340	3.0	a	Wilson, 173.
1341	3.0	a	The Exposition
1342	3.0	a	Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition, nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears.
1343	3.2	a	Harmonic Structure and Form
1344	2.9	a	The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over.
1345	3.0	a	Bartók describes the form of the first movement as “more or less regular sonata form.”
1346	3.0	a	While the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the Introduction is clear in the latter, the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation.
1347	3.0	a	Rhythmically, we have a dissonance between the melody, which follows the written meter, and the accompanying chords in the bassoons, horns and lower strings.
1348	3.0	a	Example 9 reproduces the chords, and Example 10 rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern.
1349	3.1	a	As Example 10 shows, the chords are more-or-less in duple meter (4/8 and 2/8) with one “hiccup” occurring in the 5/8 measure.
1350	3.0	a	This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody (with its own “hiccups” occurring in the written 2/8 measures).
1351	2.86	a	As we will later see, this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation.
1352	3.0	a	While the material occasionally departs from this F in measures 76-94, these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged F.
1353	3.0	a	E♭ is the tonal center for measures 95-134, although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131.
1354	3.0	a	Measures 95-130 contain a mostly chromatic descent from C to E♭, where E♭ is anticipated throughout as a goal tone for the bass.
1355	3.0	a	Example 11 illustrates this structure.
1356	3.14	a	Immediately following the arrival of E♭ in the bass, C♯ (D♭) is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme.
1357	3.0	a	Note that the initial G♯ is a pickup to the section in C♯, which fills in the whole-tone descent from E♭ to C♯ with the intervening fourth.
1358	3.0	a	This motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of G♯-C♯-B-E (with the addition of some passing tones), in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths.
1359	3.0	a	Wilson claims that C and E♭ are “local dominants” to F in this first section of the exposition.
1360	3.0	a	While the strong V-I motion from measures 90-91 does carry a tonal implication of dominant-tonic, such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context.
1361	2.9	a	E♭, furthermore, is not convincingly established as a dominant-functioning tone at all.
1362	3.0	a	The passage from measures 85-89 is centered on E♭ (and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step), but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function.
1363	3.0	a	Rather, we can consider this occurrence of E♭ as a middleground-level whole-tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E♭ at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2.
1364	3.0	a	In measures 91-95, the bass descends F-E♭-D♭-C, which might seem to support C’s functioning as structural dominant.
1365	3.0	a	However, as previously mentioned, C acts as a “fake” dominant that in measures 149-155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to B, the “true” dominant.
1366	3.0	a	This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge.
1367	3.14	a	The second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple, which is in stark contrast to the first theme.
1368	2.88	a	B dominates as tonal center from measures 155-191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it.
1369	2.9	a	Measures 192-197 are in E♭, with the bass notes in the harp, and measures 198-209 are in D♭.
1370	3.0	a	A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure 195—another instance of the whole-tone being “filled in” by a fourth.
1371	3.0	a	The return to B in measure 210 is also filled-in in this way by F♯ in measures 208-209.
1372	3.0	a	Hence, measures 155-210 constitute the bass progression B-E♭-D♭-B; the same stepwise descent (E♭-D♭) occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged.
1373	3.0	a	Paul Wilson points out that “[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”
1374	3.0	a	“[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”
1375	3.0	a	In our terminology, this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant.
1376	3.18	a	The Development
1377	3.0	a	As mentioned, the development is divided into three subsections.
1378	3.0	a	In Example 2, the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches, and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal center—none of these pitches is involved in the structural whole-tone descent.
1379	3.18	a	As Paul Wilson states, the development “is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”; the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified, and tonalities other than those expected arise.
1380	3.0	a	“is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”
1381	3.0	a	The only slight abnormality, though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical-period sonata movements, is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development.
1382	3.0	a	Also see Bartók’s comments on that (Bartók, 414).
1383	3.0	a	Wilson, 182.
1384	2.88	a	there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives, and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm, contour and interval content are changed.
1385	3.0	a	Before beginning an analysis of any piece by Béla Bartók, one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used.
1386	3.0	a	Furthermore, this section, being the middle section of the movement, upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme.
1387	2.86	a	The first section of the development, measures 231-271, begins with a big D-minor chord which immediately establishes D as the tonal center for the section.
1388	3.0	a	Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction.
1389	3.0	a	The passage beginning at measure 248, shown in Example 13, can be considered to be the “theme” of this section, and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme.
1390	3.0	a	This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section.
1391	3.0	a	While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261-264 as 6-Z50 ([014679]), identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence (+5, -2, +5) from the original motive.
1392	3.0	a	This section is reproduced as Example 14.
1393	3.0	a	Because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to B in the second theme group, we could conceive of C# as a sub-dominant in this movement.
1394	2.7	a	As tempting as this interpretation may be, this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology—there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms.
1395	3.0	a	The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12, transposed to begin on F, and turns it into a fugato sequence, reproduced in Example 17.
1396	3.0	a	As previously mentioned, the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the Introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme.
1397	3.0	a	The resultant set is the pentatonic set F-B♭-E♭-A♭-D♭; the entire passage shown in Example 17 remains within this set.
1398	3.0	a	The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B♭ rather than C, which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center).
1399	3.0	a	The second instance of the fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18, is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C.
1400	3.2	a	The inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363.
1401	3.0	a	The following section (measures 363-389) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set, so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section—only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation.
1402	3.0	a	Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies the arrival on A, and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large-scale whole-tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section.
1403	3.0	a	Hence, on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG-STG-FTG which makes the overall form, with the exception of the Introduction, symmetric.
1404	3.1	a	The Recapitulation
1405	3.0	a	The recapitulation, as we have seen, presents the themes in reverse order.
1406	3.0	a	The second theme is initially presented in A, as part of the whole-tone descent, and proceeds directly to G, where it is restated slightly modified.
1407	3.0	a	The A♯ in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area, but it leads to D in measure 444, which constitutes a V chord still applied to G.
1408	3.1	a	Rather than resolve this D back to G, however, Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467.
1409	3.38	a	E and F♯ are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme (measures 456-487) which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F, which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the much-anticipated recapitulation of the first theme.
1410	3.0	a	The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences.
1411	2.91	a	In the recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody.
1412	3.0	a	In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation.
1413	3.0	a	Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement, although his interpretation is somewhat different.
1414	3.1	a	In addition to the “mode”-shift, we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears (notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19) and also that the written meter no longer changes.
1415	3.1	a	In other words, the piece, in becoming more regular, is beginning to drive towards the finish—because of the formal structure, the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement.
1416	3.1	a	Indeed, this section has the feel of a Coda to it—it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection, and the tonic harmony is active throughout.
1417	3.12	a	Bartók is one of the many early-twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality.
1418	3.1	a	While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind, and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions, by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work.
1419	3.2	a	Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum.
1420	3.1	a	But if we apply it to music such as Bartók’s that is in the middle area, we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results.
1421	3.0	a	To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra.
1422	3.1	a	By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm, we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain, but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions.
1423	3.18	a	It is not disputed that Bartók’s music has great expressive power—perhaps now we can understand why.
1424	3.0	a	The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group, respectively.
1425	3.1	a	While “tonality” in this piece (and in Bartók’s music in general) is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata-form structure.
1426	2.88	a	Bartók’s music, although it is often difficult to call completely tonal, never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure.
1427	3.0	a	To begin with, the movement is in F.
1428	3.1	a	In this example, the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece (Introduction–Exposition–Development­–Recapitulation)—so we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins.
1429	3.0	a	The middle pitch of the descent, B, acts as the “dominant” to F, based on its symmetrical division of the whole-tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition.
1430	2.8	a	This remains true even with one of his last compositions, the Concerto for Orchestra, written two years before his death in 1943.
1431	2.9	a	Bartók has often applied a tonic-dominant relationship to a pitch-class and its tritone partner, and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet.
1432	3.0	a	See Bartók, 414-415.
1433	2.9	a	In this particular movement, Bartók feigns moving to the tonal dominant, C, for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D♭ and B—this and other subtleties shown in Example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections.
1434	3.0	a	Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure.
1435	3.0	a	The graph in Example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis; while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements, it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced, this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper.
1436	3.0	a	The Introduction
1437	3.0	a	As Paul Wilson points out, the title “Introduzione” given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures.
1438	3.0	a	The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto, focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement.
1439	3.0	a	The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece.
1440	3.0	a	To begin with, the opening motive in the celli and basses, shown in Example 3, outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center.
1441	3.12	a	The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive.
1442	3.0	a	Furthermore, the following two instances of this opening motive, shown in Examples 4 and 5, remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth, and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set.
1443	3.1	a	Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths.
1444	2.9	a	Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set derived by stacking fourths.
1445	3.0	a	If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example.
1446	3.0	a	Each note is either approached or left (or both) by a fourth, and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯.
1447	3.1	a	The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C♯ to D♯, through F♯; these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D♭, E♭ and G♭.
1448	2.8	a	As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F.
1449	3.1	a	So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth.
1450	3.0	a	This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group (mm.
1451	3.0	a	We will also examine to what degree a “tonal” reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bartók strays from common-practice compositional techniques.
1452	3.0	a	155-233), and as we will see, it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2.
1453	3.1	a	Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths, the same sequence of intervals occurs: two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second (-5, +2, -5); each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples.
1454	3.0	a	This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition, shown in measures 2-3 of Example 8.
1455	3.0	a	The concluding motive of this section in the violins (the bracketed sections of Example 6), as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff.
1456	3.0	a	(Example 7), are related to the first head motive of the first theme, which is shown in the first measure of Example 8.
1457	3.0	a	All three of these motives span a tritone, which as mentioned is the “dominant” relationship in this movement.
1458	3.13	a	For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and architectural spaces.
1459	2.8	a	Why in a world filled with color do we feel the need to purge it from our space?
1460	3.12	a	The white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set before them.
1461	2.9	a	It stabilizes and controls forms because it brings to light the contours of the space.
1462	3.0	a	In the 19th century it became fashionable for bourgeois women to dress in white, while men dressed in black (Wigley).
1463	2.9	a	What exactly is the debate between colorlessness vs color and more specifically can black and white be considered non-colors?
1464	2.75	a	These distinctions proved a certain rational order, only attained by those able to afford of it.
1465	3.0	a	White walls, white clothing, they both require much more maintenance than something colored where a stain can merely hide away among the other colors.
1466	3.4	a	Crisp whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury, and leisure.
1467	3.1	a	White clothing proved that someone was of a level of society in which they were not forced to work, for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why women who were the ones to stay at home dressed in all white, while men who were the ones to go out and work wore black, for black did in fact hide stains.
1468	3.0	a	The same goes with white walls, in their impeccability it proved to whoever, that the owner could afford to not live actually live in this space, or could afford more simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint.
1469	3.22	a	Both as well were signs of the modern age man had reached.
1470	3.29	a	The use of white was proof that man had conquered nature.
1471	2.9	a	The use of white and black in dress and architecture also became a way of distinguishing oneself from the vulgar, normal, lower classes.
1472	3.0	a	Ever since the dawn of man, human society has evolved in ways which attempt to ultimately control nature.
1473	3.0	a	Furthermore, with the advent of industrialization the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for all classes.
1474	3.5	a	Now, anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and the masses began to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them.
1475	3.1	a	Seeing as color is something of the natural world, age old and archaic, washing it away from our lives is the ultimate form of rising above the physical world.
1476	3.0	a	Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness.
1477	2.9	a	Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society, the wearing of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so.
1478	3.11	a	This simplicity of dress was seen as a mark of the modern man.
1479	3.0	a	Other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on this preference for black and white.
1480	3.2	a	Photography took over as a means of portraiture for the bourgeois and the upper class and despite the fact that it was possible to color the photographs, for the most part they were left in black and white because it was seen as more “natural”.
1481	3.14	a	“This world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform, a world in “black and white”
1482	3.0	a	This led to the idea of writing = rationality = production that confined images, especially images in color, to the emerging field of “art”, which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially unproductive, while it assigned to the two-toned and orderly world of printed paper the role of a daily guide to existence”
1483	3.12	a	Black and white became a symbol for the superiority of man’s intellect and technology.
1484	3.0	a	This then translated down into the world of fashion, as seen with the distinction between black and white clothing, as well as art, namely photography but also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space.
1485	3.09	a	Seeing as since the time of Aristotle, form was valued over that of color, the arts which did not require color to be enjoyed were perceived to be that of a higher form.
1486	3.3	a	“Kitsch is a product of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of Western Europe and America and established what is called universal literacy”
1487	3.0	a	Kitsch made cheap what once was truly cultural by the way it reproduced it d infinitum.
1488	3.0	a	Greenberg continues by saying, “Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility.
1489	3.25	a	It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas.
1490	2.5	a	Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations.
1491	2.8	a	Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money -- not even their time”.
1492	3.1	a	With the advent of kitsch came a great need for the distinction between higher and lower artforms.
1493	3.0	a	Inorganic nature has only the language of color.
1494	2.8	a	Thus said, this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the cause for the belief that which was black and white was deemed a serious, high art, while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes.
1495	3.1	a	Of course during the early stages of color film and photography, the quality was so poor that it gave a cheap look, whereas black and white film really allowed one to see the light and the shadows in the images.
1496	3.1	a	For the play of light and form was key in demonstrating the true art form.
1497	2.9	a	Color was thought to distract the viewer from the soul of the image.
1498	3.0	a	These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being almost better than reality.
1499	3.0	a	Still though black and white is seen as something of a more sober tradition.
1500	3.2	a	These non colors allow for the appreciation of color.
1501	3.0	a	When something is black and white, it allows the mind to fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen.
1502	3.0	a	It is for this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an intellectual process.
1503	2.71	a	Whether it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non color, the use of black and white has been debated over for the last hundred years.
1504	3.0	a	Now we have entered an era where we are seeing once again more color, but perhaps it is human instinct, to want to surpass and rebel against generations before, so possibly we shall return to a state of non color veneration.
1505	3.11	a	What is typical of this sort of ascetism is the art of expressing as much as possible using the minimum as an ideal.
1506	3.0	a	This is apparent through Japanese haiku as well as the art of ink painting in both China and Japan.
1507	2.91	a	For them, reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in its most minimal form.
1508	3.0	a	In the Elimination of color in the Far East, Izutsu explains though how this ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine knowledge of color.
1509	2.9	a	What would our lives be without color?
1510	2.9	a	At the same time in our modern society, color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the enlightened mind and space.
1511	3.1	a	It is through the absence of color that one brings to mind the colors that are no longer present.
1512	3.0	a	It is up to the mind to fill in the blank space.
1513	3.18	a	Without color one could not appreciate the purity of the black and white space.
1514	3.1	a	colorlessness needs color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place.
1515	3.3	a	Black and white are the consummation of all colors into one.
1516	3.0	a	“Black is life; it is the infinite possibility of expression and development. Black here is not sheer black.
1517	3.22	a	For in it’s negation of all colors, all colors are positively affirmed”
1518	3.1	a	It is through these means that one finds the essence in a thing.
1519	2.88	a	In Western society, this purging of color began with the rejection of ideals of generations past.
1520	2.8	a	Eliminating color was a way of eliminating the decadence of the 18th century.
1521	3.09	a	Society turned to minimalism as a way of cleansing life, representing modernity.
1522	2.8	a	color became a moral issue, seen as something sensuous and dangerous in its secondary nature to the essence of life and form.
1523	2.89	a	“The predominance of color at the expense of drawing is a usurpation of the relative over the absolute, of fleeting appearance over permanent form, of physical impression over the empire of the soul”
1524	2.8	a	color rests on the surface of an object, it is superficial, cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it hides the true nature of that thing.
1525	2.71	a	color is associated with the Fall from Grace.
1526	3.0	a	It is something which speaks to the senses, not the mind, it is external and therefore secondary to life.
1527	3.12	a	It deals with the body, emotions, not the intellect.
1528	2.5	a	It strays from reason in the way which it consumes and manipulates life.
1529	3.14	a	For [Charles Blanc] color also represents a kind of ruination. color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization, the nobility of the human spirit, slowly, heroically, has lifted itself – but back into which it could always slide
1530	3.4	a	It is a descent in the way it makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire, and to desire is to lose control over oneself.
1531	3.0	a	We went from times of celebrating color and decoration to one of minimalism where black and white were placed at the front as representations of modernity and ultimate transcendence.
1532	3.0	a	Thus, began the cult of the black and white.
1533	3.2	a	White is seen as representing spirituality, the heavens, and light, it is all which is modern, it signifies the opposite of the carnal nature of color.
1534	3.29	a	It is the control of nature, and the body and represents the modern man.
1535	3.2	a	We have superceded both the ‘brown’ of decadence and classiscm and the ‘blue’ of divisionism, the cult of the blue ky, the gods with green beards and the spectrum.
1536	2.88	a	WHITE pure white.
1537	3.1	a	For these reasons black and white have been placed at the top of the hierarchy of colors.
1538	2.7	a	Abolishing color means controlling color.
1539	3.12	a	“The white surface exposes color, presents it for disciplining.
1540	3.0	a	It keeps an eye on all the objects it frames.
1541	3.0	a	But before that, it keeps an eye on itself, watching its freshly laundered and neatly folded fabric for the stain of color”
1542	2.8	a	colorlessness is not natural, and thus proves man’s superiority over this world.
1543	3.11	a	On the other hand, we need color in order to distinguish black and white.
1544	2.88	a	Just as those from the Far East, the purity of white implies what has been washed away and thus makes the white glitter even more.
1545	3.0	a	White and black stand out because of color, and color stand out because of white and black.
1546	3.0	a	They are linked intrinsically together, one cannot go without the other.
1547	3.0	a	“White is the setting for color.
1548	3.1	a	The forms stand out clearly; the impeccable construction displays all its boldness.
1549	3.2	a	At times a high stylobate of delightful ceramic produces a blue vibration.”
1550	2.9	a	We need this opposition between color and ‘non-color’ to make distinction between the two, otherwise neither would hold such significance.
1551	3.1	a	Reaching Transcendence through the Elimination of color: The Ideal Minimalism of Black and White
1552	3.1	a	White helps to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash, it brings together and unites.
1553	3.0	a	The use of white is therefore decisive for the bodily appearance of a space.
1554	2.88	a	Concrete bodies decrease the space more or less depending on their color value.
1555	2.62	a	and how can the state legislature single out two counties (first Napa, now Sonoma) for this treatment?
1556	3.0	a	are they going to go through the wine-producing counties one by one?
1557	3.0	a	JohnLopresti said...
1558	2.89	a	vive la OIVV OIV_Wine_Labelling_Standard_EN_2006 re at Fredric K's BTYH website there is a review discussing MacRostie pinot noir.
1559	3.0	a	I had thought of the kiltman with respect to a new AVA in Yorkville highlands, thinking the Scot might have interest in playing the bagpipes in the uplands.
1560	3.0	a	Then, at Steve's site there is an interesting discussion of his current ongoing efforts with blends from Carneros and Sonoma Coast.
1561	3.0	a	There are 13 AVAs in Sonoma County.
1562	2.86	a	In a way, all this tries to approach terroir from a slight distance; plus the historical distinctions between the two premium distinctive varietal regions, Napa county and Sonoma county.
1563	3.0	a	Winkler heat summation datapoints also clarified several decades ago some of the plant physiologic underpinnings of why Napa county and Sonoma county were the natural leaders in premium winegrape production.
1564	2.8	a	"The problem, of course, is that by placing the words ""Sonoma County"" on a bottle of wine that is made with grapes grown in ""Russian River Valley"", ""Dry Creek Valley"", ""Sonoma Valley"" or any other AVA in Sonoma"

1567	3.0	a	"OK, so here's the real requirement: ""Any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area established yada yada, that is located entirely within yada yada, shall bear the designation ""Sonoma County"" on the label in a type size not smaller than two millimeters on containers of more than 187 milliliters or smaller than one millimeter on containers of 187 milliliters or less."
1568	2.66	a	"So the answer seems pretty clear to me: just add ""Sonoma County"" to the government warning."
1569	3.0	a	Johnonwine said...
1570	2.9	a	"But this prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands ""Napa Valley"", in addition to simply ""Rutherford"", be placed on these wines."

1572	2.75	a	"Such an association will not be made with ""Sonoma County"" wines...ever."
1573	3.1	a	Tom, I would suggest that all Napa wineries, good and bad, benefit from having Napa Valley on the label; it is indeed a great example of marketing - what you describe as promotional effort.
1574	2.6	a	County, consumers learn absolutely nothing about the wine in the bottle.
1575	2.9	a	"Heck, if folks knew all that, maybe folks would be seeking out bottles with ""Sonoma County"" on the label."
1576	2.5	a	You suggest that this is a bad law, that Sonoma County will never be associated with high quality wine in the way Napa County is.
1577	3.12	a	I disagree, but I am eternally hopeful, optimistic that the Sonoma County Vintners will inject a little passion and not more of the same old staid and boring in their marketing communications.
1578	3.7	a	I have confidence they will change, retool, improve, live up to their responsibilities.
1579	3.5	a	I worked selling and marketing Sonoma County wines, I won awards for my marketing efforts.
1580	3.11	a	The story is simple.
1581	3.25	a	People are receptive to it.
1582	3.83	a	Selling the magic of Sonoma County wines is easy.
1583	2.8	a	That's my take anyway, I don't aim to be contrarian, but I don't mind being the sole supporter of the law - as a Sonoma County born and bred wine guy.
1584	3.2	a	She's correct.
1585	2.4	a	"Frankly, if I was making high end wine from the ""Sonoma Valley"", ""Sonoma Mountain"" or ""Sonoma Coast"" AVAs that depended in part on the quality recognition that comes wtih these AVAs, I'd be pissed that I'm forced now to put a place-name on my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about the wine behind my label and, in some cases, demonstrably lowered its perceived quality."
1586	3.3	a	"""This moment ...marks the beginning of a stronger Sonoma County brand for generations to come."""
1587	3.0	a	"Proponents of the new Sonoma County Conjunctive labeling law like to point to a similar law that demands ""Napa Valley"" be placed on all wines that are made from grapes grown in that appellation, rather than simply using a sub appellation."
1588	2.82	a	"But this prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands ""Napa Valley"", in addition to simply ""Rutherford"", be placed on these wines."
1589	3.1	a	"It has to do entirely with the promotional effort that has gone into making ""Napa Valley"" a place associated with great wines."
1590	3.0	a	"The vintners in Sonoma County simply can't make a case for ""Sonoma County"" having any meaning or for a region as vast as ""Sonoma County"" delivering any degree of quality to the grapes."
1591	2.8	a	"Pushed as an effort to promote ""Sonoma County"" wines and a consumer education effort, the new law instead forces vintners to needlessly sully their package and undermines their own marketing efforts."
1592	2.88	a	"Why is it important for someone making ""Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir"" or ""Sonoma Valley Zinfandel"" to help promote ""Sonoma County"", a designation that has no ability to define the quality or character of the wines in my Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir or my Sonoma Valley Zinfandel?"
1593	3.0	a	They legally could...if they wanted to.
1594	2.5	a	The new Sonoma County conjunctive labeling law is the equivalent of the State of California and the County of Sonoma claiming imminent domain over the labels of hundreds of vintners.

1624	3.1	a	I put in 1+ decades in trade coursework, and several branches of the industry.
1625	3.33	a	I support the new labeling requirement.
1626	3.33	a	Together we have led the world into modern viticulture, with the help of UC Davis, and in some pretty good company from other regions.
1627	3.25	a	But I think it will improve northcoast revenue and dignity.
1628	2.9	a	When I was a kid in a county called Solano (not too famous for wines or AVAs) people sometimes would happen by our place asking where rte 37 was, where was Black Pt.; people always were confused how the somewhat neighboring counties had such similar names.
1629	2.9	a	"According to Noreen Evans, an Assembly sponsor of the bill, this new conjunctive labeling law ""requires that any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located entirely within Sonoma County - – like Russian River Valley or Dry Creek Valley - must also include the word ""Sonoma County"" on the label, starting in 2014."
1630	3.14	a	Now after several decades in Sonoma county I have learned to appreciate its uniqueness, for its viticulture and other industries.
1631	3.4	a	The ambience in the town Sonoma is only an enclave; it is rightfully proud of its heritage as a village, and for its viticultural traditions.
1632	3.0	a	But Sonoma county encompasses much more territory, and other AVAs within the county are starkly different from the characteristics of Sonoma valley and the town of Sonoma.

1689	3.1	a	"""Today’s system balances competition with public safety to ensure that consumers can enjoy alcohol without suffering the negative effects of an unregulated marketplace"""
1690	2.75	a	Is there really any competition when the state-based regulatory system the wholesalers love so much require that producers of alcohol use a wholesaler to bring their goods to market, meaning that without use of a wholesaler a producer cannot enter a state's market?
1691	2.5	a	It also means that wholesalers get to decide what consumers drink, not consumers.
1692	2.25	a	"""Unfortunately the effective state-based regulatory system in the U.S. is under attack."
1693	2.9	a	Even in the wake of successful suits that challenged the protectionist laws that wholesalers originally pushed, the state retained extraordinarily broad authority to maintain a robust system of alcohol controls.
1694	2.91	a	"ON THE ""LEARN MORE"" PAGE ( http://www.hr5034.org/learn-more ) ""Litigation against the states brought by those wishing to deregulate alcohol for their own economic interests is of great concern to state alcohol regulators, state attorneys general, public health advocates and many others."""
1695	2.8	a	"""Litigation against the states brought by those wishing to deregulate alcohol for their own economic interests is of great concern to state alcohol regulators, state attorneys general, public health advocates and many others."""
1696	2.6	a	This bill, currently in Congress, would give wholesaler lobbyists the means to turn back the clock on consumer access to wine, lead to the passage of laws that override federal regulations on alcohol, kill jobs and business that focus on artisan production of wine, beer and spirits, punish and dismantle small specialty wine retailers that serve the consumers that wholesalers won't and override the critical Constitutional principle of a single American economic union...
1697	2.5	a	When the economic interests of producers, retailers and consumers are horsewhipped by states doing the bidding of wholesales who receive more government protection and welfare from the state than any other industry in america, you might expect them to fight back.
1698	3.0	a	"As for those that have ""concern"", let's recall that it's only a tiny fraction of state alcohol regulators, that there is no formal support from state attorneys general, only a mere handful of public health advocates, a selection of recipients of campaign contributions from wholesalers and wholesalers themselves that support H.R. 5034 ."
1699	2.5	a	"""concern"""
1700	2.5	a	"I'm shocked, shocked i say, that the ""center for alcohol policy"" is an arm of the national beer wholesalers association and that it would conduct a poll that finds results supporting those that funded the poll."

1702	2.8	a	Does it get any more illegitimate?
1703	3.0	a	"On the ""Fact v."

1705	2.8	a	It does not preempt a state law that allows direct shipping.
1706	3.0	a	It does not mandate a direct shipping law where there currently is not one.
1707	3.0	a	The bill does PROTECT a state’s wine shipping law if someone were to challenge it in court by providing the shipping law with the same presumption of validity granted other state alcohol laws.
1708	2.33	a	"""Disingenuous in the extreme."
1709	2.6	a	And what's worse, the wholesalers knew this when they wrote this.
1710	2.88	a	And we know such laws would be introduced into various states since wholesalers have seen to it that such laws have been introduced into state legislatures for the past 20 years.
1711	3.0	a	In fact, H.R. 5034 would allow states to pass laws that make consumers receipt of a wine by in-state shippers legal while making receipt of a wine by out-of-state shippers punishable to a greater degree than rape, home invasion or selling cocaine to children.
1712	3.0	a	"""Fact: Protection of a state’s power to regulate alcohol is not an “industry food fight.”"

1744	3.1	a	After that, the state legislatures, in every state where litigation has affected badly crafted laws, went about legislating a fix.
1745	2.86	a	But what is truly remarkable (and likely a result of the wholesalers' hubris stemming from 75 years of being granted government welfare) is their willingness to misrepresent facts, ignore the truth, and mislead in their defense of H.R. 5034.

1749	2.6	a	It appears that wholesalers don't like the courts involved when the decision don't go their way.
1750	3.11	a	The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife.
1751	3.0	a	Additional catalysts for the valley’s growth came from World War II.
1752	3.14	a	Both the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School (which became Nellis Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site) in the north, and Basic Magnesium in the nearby town of Henderson, arrived in the early 1940s as a result of America’s war effort.
1753	3.14	a	By 1945, the population had grown to almost 20,000, with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace.
1754	2.9	a	But this was not yet the Las Vegas of folklore.
1755	3.0	a	The El Rancho Vegas (1941) was the first, followed by the Last Frontier (1943).
1756	3.0	a	During this period, East Coast Syndicate member Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel earned a foothold as a local casino operator.
1757	3.1	a	When the Flamingo opened in December 1946, it did so with Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash.
1758	2.2	a	But the Mafia bosses who financed the operation were displeased with its performance; Siegel was murdered in the summer of 1947.
1759	3.0	a	Despite its initial failings, Siegel’s Flamingo survived him, as did mob infiltration of casinos.
1760	3.0	a	Freely flowing “comps” (complimentary food, drink, and entertainment) were the order of the day, with mob bosses content to provide an environment of pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in.
1761	3.1	a	While the mob was running the casinos, promoters were busily selling Las Vegas as a glamorous Hollywood in the desert.
1762	3.1	a	From the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s, Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that it was the “Entertainment Capital of the World. ”
1763	3.3	a	Emerging stars, no longer content with playing small nightclubs, came to Las Vegas with dreams of making it big.
1764	3.0	a	Many of them did.
1765	3.0	a	For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization.
1766	3.0	a	The Rat Pack — originally Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. , Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop, all in town to film Ocean’s 11 — landed at the Sands in January 1960 for a legendary stay.
1767	3.0	a	Other Hollywood stars came as well, simply because Las Vegas was the place to be.
1768	3.2	a	As a result, more casinos emerged along the Strip.
1769	3.1	a	The Thunderbird, Desert Inn, Sahara, Sands, and Riviera hotels were erected during this period, luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of all-night partying, exclusive entertainment, and cheap accommodations.
1770	3.11	a	There was no longer any question: when you wanted some unbridled adult fun, Las Vegas was the place to be.
1771	3.11	a	New Legitimacy
1772	3.0	a	That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes.
1773	3.0	a	Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley.
1774	3.2	a	A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos.
1775	2.83	a	True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn’s penthouse.
1776	3.0	a	Thus began Hughes’ legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree.
1777	3.0	a	When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains.
1778	2.88	a	Hughes’ actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting.
1779	3.1	a	Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes’ investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant.
1780	3.0	a	That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city.
1781	3.3	a	As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged.
1782	3.25	a	Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest.
1783	2.7	a	What was once a sure thing became much more competitive.
1784	3.0	a	The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget.
1785	3.2	a	In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort.
1786	3.29	a	He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.
1787	3.0	a	Wynn’s demolition of the existing properties started a trend that, more than any other, describes Las Vegas at the end of the 20th century: removal of old properties in exchange for the potential of new ones.
1788	2.91	a	This trend has led to many more demolitions, including the Dunes (replaced by Bellagio), Aladdin (the new Aladdin) and Sands (Venetian) hotels.
1789	3.0	a	Wynn’s casinos have also set new standards.
1790	3.2	a	Excalibur, the MGM Grand, the Luxor, and New York-New York all followed Mirage’s lead during the 1990s, offering themed environments and attractions for families.
1791	2.6	a	As evidence of the “ever-faster” nature of the city, by the middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash, with many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience.
1792	3.1	a	This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.
1793	3.0	a	The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post-mob era: the comprehensive resort.
1794	3.5	a	New resorts offer attractions and amenities modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide, including luxurious spas, signature restaurants, and exclusive boutiques.
1795	3.3	a	Additionally, a handful of resorts — such as the South-Seas themed Mandalay Bay, the Mirage, and the new Four Seasons — are now catering exclusively to the luxury travel market.
1796	3.5	a	Over 20,000 additional hotel rooms have been added in a few short years, including resorts in Summerlin and Lake Las Vegas.
1797	2.56	a	The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for nearly a century may be facing a roadblock.
1798	3.3	a	Still, the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else.
1799	3.6	a	With its new look and new aim, the prospects are good despite the warnings.
1800	3.0	a	Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. 1150, leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes, another hunter-gatherer tribe.
1801	3.0	a	Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the Anasazi, the Paiutes were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived, changing the nature of existence in the valley forever.
1802	3.0	a	During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline.
1803	3.0	a	From Mailmen to Mormons
1804	3.11	a	In the early nineteenth century, America’s western territories were still largely unexplored.
1805	3.2	a	It was not until 1829 that Rafael Rivera, a Mexican scout, found a spring-fed valley and dubbed it Las Vegas — a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering exactly where “the meadows” really lay.
1806	3.0	a	For fifteen years, Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail way-station.
1807	3.0	a	In 1844, American explorer John C. Fremont parked his horses at Big Springs, and his report to the government resulted in a mail route leading past the spot on its way to California.
1808	3.0	a	A Brief History
1809	3.0	a	This put Las Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its history.
1810	3.0	a	In 1855, Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising reports of Las Vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley; they eventually built a fort not far from today’s Downtown.
1811	2.4	a	Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries’ plight beyond recovery.
1812	2.2	a	Their supplies scarce, their harvest meager, and their spirit broken, they abandoned the fort in 1858.
1813	3.1	a	Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver, by 1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold.
1814	3.0	a	Bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day, Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left off — at least when it came to ranching and farming.
1815	3.0	a	The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated.
1816	3.1	a	Gass took over the abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres (260 hectares) surrounding it, dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch.
1817	3.0	a	He expanded the ranch and irrigated the land so that it would support crops and cattle.
1818	3.25	a	His determination had other results as well: Gass was named a justice of the peace and a territorial legislator.
1819	2.7	a	Despite his ambition, Gass’ success was short-lived.
1820	2.75	a	True to wild-West stereotypes, Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer, leaving his strong-willed wife, Helen, to assume the duties of the ranch.
1821	3.0	a	Fossils tell an obscure story of man’s slow and sporadic development.
1822	3.62	a	Through 1905, Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres (810 hectares), making quite a bit of money in the process.
1823	2.88	a	What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across almost all of Western America to this day.
1824	3.1	a	Early Habitation
1825	3.0	a	Of Tracks and Tracts
1826	3.1	a	At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West.
1827	2.9	a	When it did, the Las Vegas Valley (which at the time had a non-native population of less than 30) would change as well.
1828	3.18	a	Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture.
1829	3.14	a	In 1903, officials of the San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas, eager to secure a right-of-way for their Los Angeles–Salt Lake connection.
1830	3.12	a	Las Vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair.
1831	3.0	a	For all this, the railroad needed land.
1832	3.14	a	As mapped, the track traveled directly through Helen Stewart’s Las Vegas Ranch.
1833	3.2	a	Stewart sold 99.5 percent of her ranch to the railroad.
1834	3.11	a	The remainder she returned to the native Paiutes.
1835	3.2	a	In early 1905, the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City was completed, and train tracks bore right down the center of the Las Vegas Valley.
1836	3.5	a	On 15 May 1905, the railroad held a land sale — a momentous step in Las Vegas history.
1837	3.0	a	Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement.
1838	3.2	a	With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property, it was ready to become a real town.
1839	3.1	a	Businesses sprang up overnight, and wooden houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early settlers had lived.
1840	3.12	a	One year after the auction, the population of Las Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents, a portent of things to come for the next ninety years.
1841	3.5	a	Dam Good Luck
1842	3.0	a	From the beginning, Las Vegas was built to serve travelers.
1843	3.29	a	Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop.
1844	3.0	a	The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake.
1845	2.89	a	Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility.
1846	3.0	a	Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada’s new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling.
1847	2.44	a	These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents.
1848	3.22	a	But the southwest’s growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas’s fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity.
1849	3.0	a	Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas.
1850	3.0	a	Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally.
1851	3.0	a	These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River.
1852	3.5	a	Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada.
1853	2.88	a	The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however.
1854	3.1	a	The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time.
1855	3.0	a	They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted.
1856	2.9	a	It didn’t take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an “anything goes” attitude.
1857	3.0	a	Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night).
1858	3.0	a	Strangely enough, the study also included pairs of biological brothers that were not twins, and out of the 142 homosexual males studied, only 14, or about 9 %, had homosexual brothers, which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of homosexuality in the general population (Bailey & Pillard).
1859	3.2	a	More and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not a “choice,” but rather a feeling that one is born with.
1860	3.25	a	“choice,”
1861	3.1	a	As one grows older, they become aware of sexual feelings towards other persons.
1862	3.0	a	The only difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite sex, homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex.
1863	3.0	a	“Why are you attracted to other members of your sex”
1864	3.0	a	“Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?”
1865	2.7	a	After all, why would anyone choose such a difficult lifestyle?
1866	2.6	a	As a homosexual, one risks horrifying their parents, other family members, and friends to the point of losing all contact with them, ruining their career, being condemned by their religion, being beat up for publicly displaying their sexuality, and much much more.
1867	3.0	a	This shows that not only did Plato consider it normal for a male to be attracted to another male, he also believed that it began at a very young age, as the word “boyhood” signifies.
1868	3.0	a	To supplement my findings from research, I have conducted personal interviews with two adolescent homosexual males, James Dobbens and Daniel Woods.
1869	2.9	a	Both believed that homosexual was a result of nature, rather than nurture (Dobbens & Woods).
1870	2.8	a	Dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual; “They’re not like ‘My child’s going to be gay!”’
1871	2.7	a	“They’re not like ‘My child’s going to be gay!”’
1872	3.0	a	‘My child’s going to be gay!”’
1873	3.1	a	Dobbens believes that he was born homosexual.
1874	3.1	a	When why he was a homosexual, he explained “It’s just the way you are, you can’t explain it, I was just born that way, it’s like asking how the world was made – no one really knows” (Dobbens).
1875	3.1	a	“It’s just the way you are, you can’t explain it, I was just born that way, it’s like asking how the world was made – no one really knows”
1876	3.0	a	He went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation, it did affect his view of it.
1877	3.0	a	When discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a child’s sexuality, he commented “They can bring you up [to be] open minded to [homosexuality], but they don’t bring you up [to be a homosexual]… I grew up in a place where [homosexuality is accepted], so that’s why I’m so open about being gay; I accept myself… [Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual] depends on how you’re brought up” (Dobbens).
1878	3.0	a	“They can bring you up [to be] open minded to [homosexuality], but they don’t bring you up [to be a homosexual]… I grew up in a place where [homosexuality is accepted], so that’s why I’m so open about being gay; I accept myself… [Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual] depends on how you’re brought up”
1879	2.9	a	Woods generally agreed with Dobbens, and justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one’s nature, rather than nurture, when he commented that “there’s nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to anything like [homosexuality]” (Woods).
1880	3.0	a	“boyhood”
1881	3.0	a	In fact, Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only “real and lasting love” and necessary for democracy.
1882	3.0	a	When asked why he was gay, he explained that it is simply “something that I can’t help… embedded in my head; nothing made me do it” (Woods).
1883	2.9	a	He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction between males and females, only it was between males and other males.
1884	3.12	a	“nothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it’s always been there. I’ve always been attracted to guys”
1885	3.0	a	What I find to be extraordinary about Woods’ case is that he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys, he is romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend and to be close with other females, etc… but never in a sexual sense.
1886	3.22	a	Though he has “always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],” these feelings come from his “romantic side, which is different from the sexual side” (Woods).
1887	3.3	a	“always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],”
1888	3.1	a	He says that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust, maybe he could work it out.
1889	4.12	a	“real and lasting love”
1890	2.7	a	“It’s like race. It’s all something you can’t help; it all comes to you… It’s internal, you can’t help it”
1891	2.9	a	It’s all something you can’t help; it all comes to you… It’s internal, you can’t help it” (Woods).
1892	2.9	a	When asked if he thought homosexuality was caused by a gene, he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct.
1893	3.0	a	He gave the example of birds, which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build a next, or catch their prey.
1894	3.2	a	Furthermore, there were many occurrences of homosexual behavior in Greek mythology; Hercules is rumored to have had 14 male lovers, and Zeus himself partook in such behavior.
1895	3.0	a	All in all, Woods views homosexuality as “fascinating.”
1896	3.0	a	His final thought: “I also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction.
1897	3.0	a	According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, the advantageous traits are passed on, while the disadvantageous ones eventually die out.
1898	3.0	a	For instance, heterosexual males have an average of five times as many children as homosexual ones, as a female is required to reproduce children, yet homosexuals are, by definition, not sexually attracted to females.
1899	3.0	a	Therefore, from the evolutionary standpoint, homosexuality becomes one of the disadvantageous traits.
1900	3.1	a	Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool, if homosexuality was indeed caused by a gene, it would have died out entirely by now, or at least been reduced immensely in the number of occurrences.
1901	3.0	a	Since neither of these events have yet taken place, it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene (Fulkerson).
1902	2.33	a	No one knows for sure now (although many think they do), and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth.
1903	2.9	a	Perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations.
1904	3.0	a	However this does not necessarily determine a homosexual; rather this predisposition must be triggered by environmental factors.
1905	3.25	a	Even Homer wrote about Achilles and Patroclus, who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love (Emond).
1906	2.88	a	This is why Bailey and Pillard found in their study that while they was a greatly elevated chance that two males sharing the same genetic makeup would also share the same sexuality, this was not the case 100 % of the time.
1907	3.0	a	This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now, but even as I write this, new studies are being done.
1908	2.9	a	Perhaps the truth is right around the corner.

1916	3.0	a	Woods, Daniel S. Telephone interview. 6 June 2002.
1917	3.1	a	“a man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex”
1918	3.0	a	(However, for the purposes of this paper, homosexuality will be looked at solely in terms of men).
1919	2.9	a	At this point in time, Karl Maria Kertbeny used the word in a pamphlet which fought to repeal the current antihomosexual laws of Prussia.
1920	3.0	a	Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for “same” and the Latin word for “sex,” whereas a heterosexual is a person” whose feelings of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex” (Marcus 1).
1921	3.0	a	“same”
1922	3.5	a	“sex,”
1923	3.0	a	” whose feelings of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex”
1924	2.75	a	Others would argue that it is a result of a child’s upbringing.
1925	3.09	a	It was also in the 1800s when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was started by Magnus Hirschfeld, a physician, sex researcher, leading sexologist, homosexual, and founder of the first gay rights movement in Germany, who believed that homosexuality was biological in nature (Marcus 10).
1926	3.0	a	Hirschfeld also founded the Scientific Humanitarian committee, which was mostly homosexual, in 1897.
1927	3.09	a	The committee published many books and other forms of literature, which gave Hirschfeld a great amount of prestige in his field.
1928	2.9	a	Still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be cured.
1929	2.9	a	The debate over homosexuality has been one of the most long-lasting and controversial ones ever.
1930	2.83	a	This theory, which defined Urnings as males who turned to other males as sexual partners, was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs, starting in1864.
1931	3.0	a	The first, Vindex, defended Urnings, while the second, Inclusa, which followed shortly after, described the first scientific theory of homoerotic desire.
1932	2.9	a	“hermaphrodites of the mind,”
1933	3.1	a	Perhaps then, it is a combination of some of these?
1934	2.9	a	This, he claimed, made laws such as paragraph 175, a law adopted by King William I throughout the German Kingdoms at the time of their unification which forbade sex between males, and forced criminal penalties upon individuals partaking in such behavior, unfair and unreasonable .
1935	2.78	a	No one knows for sure, and it is possible no one ever will, but that surely does not stop everyone from coming up with their own theories and beliefs on the matter.
1936	2.9	a	A couple thousand years after Plato and Homer, Sigmund Freud still believed homosexuality to be a natural behavior.
1937	2.67	a	In an interview in 1903, he professed his beliefs: “I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people… Homosexual persons are not sick.
1938	2.87	a	“I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people… Homosexual persons are not sick. They also do not belong in a court of law!”
1939	2.18	a	They also do not belong in a court of law!”
1940	3.0	a	In 1935, he furthered his claims when he wrote a now famous “Letter to an American Mother” of a homosexual, which stated that “Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness… Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals” (qtd. in Isay 3).
1941	3.2	a	“Letter to an American Mother”
1942	3.2	a	“Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness… Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals”
1943	2.8	a	However, the general public of the 1800s and early 1900s, including the medical professionals, regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness.
1944	2.8	a	Treatments such as castration, hysterectomy, lobotomy, and electroshock therapy were used as attempted cures.
1945	3.22	a	Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a heterosexual psychologist, conducted a ground-breaking study in the mid 1950s that went along similar reasoning as Freud.
1946	3.0	a	In this courageous experiment, Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men, half homosexual and half heterosexual.
1947	2.5	a	“gay”
1948	3.2	a	Documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient Greece and other cultures of the time, where it was considered to be a very normal and natural occurrence (Emond).
1949	3.0	a	Fortunately, many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an illness, and their lobbying, along with the innovative study performed by Hooker, who has been referred to as “the Rosa Parks of the gay movement” convinced the American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of 1973.
1950	3.0	a	“the Rosa Parks of the gay movement”
1951	3.44	a	Just over a year later, the American Psychological Association also removed homosexuality from their list of mental illnesses (Marcus 11).
1952	3.0	a	The American Psychological Association further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the Council of Representatives adopted the Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation in 1997, which publicly chastised those who attempted to “cure” homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment.
1953	3.0	a	Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by Michael Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University, and Richard Pillard, an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics.
1954	3.0	a	For two years, these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both monozygotic, or identical twins (a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg and thus having identical DNA), and dizygotic, or fraternal twins (a set of twins from too separate zygotes, causing them to have similar DNA, but not any more so than that of two ordinary siblings), in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males (meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment).
1955	3.0	a	In his book The Symposium, Plato wrote “Those who are halves of a man whole pursue males, and being slices, so to speak, of the male, love men throughout their boyhood, and take pleasure in physical contact with men” (qtd. in Isay 11).
1956	3.0	a	In total, 110 pairs of twins (identical and fraternal) and 142 sets of male and their adopted brothers were studied, where at least one of the two had been classified as homosexual, either by self-identification or other means.
1957	3.09	a	“Those who are halves of a man whole pursue males, and being slices, so to speak, of the male, love men throughout their boyhood, and take pleasure in physical contact with men”
1958	3.0	a	Out of the 56 homosexual males who had identical twins, 29, or approximately 52 % of their identical twin brothers were also found to be homosexual, as compared to only 12, or approximately 22 % of the 54 non-identical twins of homosexual males, and 6, or approximately 11 % of the 57 adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of genetics.
1959	3.62	a	Pretty cool, right?
1960	3.3	a	In fact, as I recall, they got over 1 million Facebook fans.
1961	2.1	a	But then something not so awesome happened.
1962	2.89	a	All those fans wanted their free burgers and they wanted them now!
1963	3.0	a	Now from a short term perspective I'm sure they did ok on the deal.
1964	3.2	a	People came in and ate their food.
1965	3.0	a	But they decided to go the Social Media route.
1966	3.13	a	Now, let's take a look at what the Friday's FanWoody Facebook page looks like today: Whoops!
1967	3.0	a	Oh, the numbers look good, but when you dig a little deeper a different picture emerges.
1968	2.86	a	How come?
1969	3.0	a	A TGI Friday's Facebook page does exist, with roughly a third of the fans they used to have.
1970	2.4	a	TGI Friday's pretty much had to spray Agent Orange on their relationship with 600,000 people.
1971	2.88	a	I think plenty of brands have heard the siren call of Facebook ads.
1972	2.71	a	"The ability to target your demo is really terrific, but you're in danger of creating a relationship with fans that ultimately is built on a ""what have you done for me lately"" foundation."
1973	2.83	a	First, you essentially bought these fans.
1974	2.89	a	You paid Facebook for the right to target them.
1975	2.57	a	Walls filled with off topic conversations at best, vile language and real antipathy for the brand at worst.
1976	2.89	a	Then in the case of TGI Friday's or other brands that offer free product or discount coupons, you are essentially buying them again.
1977	2.9	a	This sets up a pattern where the consumer now expects to be rewarded for being your fan with a tangible item, that is, free stuff.
1978	3.18	a	That's not a bonus item, it's now a standard part of the agreement.
1979	3.2	a	Want me as a fan?
1980	3.2	a	Give me free stuff.
1981	3.11	a	The point of Social Media isn't to distribute coupons and a real fan wants to engage with a brand for a whole host of reasons, often free / discounted product is the least of these reasons.
1982	2.91	a	I'm not saying that special bonuses, or 'surprise and delight' offers aren't ever a good thing.
1983	3.1	a	I think when used properly they can be terrific.
1984	2.9	a	What do I mean by used properly?
1985	3.2	a	As a reward for people who have engaged with the brand in a meaningful way.
1986	3.22	a	Send us a picture of you wearing a brand t-shirt and sure, you've earned a free sandwich.
1987	2.87	a	But when fans enter the relationship feeling they are entitled to free samples and you're in trouble.
1988	3.0	a	What happened?
1989	3.0	a	Kathy Sharpe says: April 18, 2010 at 1:02 pm
1990	3.4	a	About time there was some acknowledgement of the true value of fans.
1991	2.9	a	Even if you have 3 million+ fans and they are all well behaved citizens what is the real marketing value?
1992	2.9	a	Wasn't having thousands of fans supposed to be a good thing?
1993	3.75	a	Sure, it's great having several hundred thousands fans.
1994	2.9	a	Facebook Fans: You Get What You Pay For 24 Mar 2010 by Rick
1995	3.1	a	But how did you come to get those fans?
1996	3.0	a	Did you earn them through fantastic customer service, fulfilling the brand promise, providing value to the community in an authentic and passionate voice, or did you run a Facebook ad campaign and hit the broadcast airwaves with a promotion?
1997	2.1	a	Take a look at the Facebook Fan Pages of some brands and what you see is not a pretty picture.
1998	3.0	a	Get Flash Player from Adobe.
1999	3.1	a	Remember that ad?
2000	3.5	a	"""I've won at every level but college and pro,"""
2001	3.3	a	That's one of the reasons  Shaq's been a huge hit on Twitter .
2002	3.0	a	I think an appropriate comparison might be Alex Rodriguez.
2003	3.1	a	He's also a very astute individual who understands how to use the media -- and various communication channels -- to his advantage.
2004	2.8	a	Ask A-Rod how the media can turn on you when you put yourself above your teammates, above the game.
2005	3.0	a	James now finds himself in the following position:
2006	2.22	a	2. Not winning a title will be seen as a massive disappointment
2007	3.0	a	3. Winning a title will result in some saying that he couldn't do it alone
2008	3.0	a	Sounds just like Alex Rodriguez, doesn't it?
2009	3.9	a	Winning championships.
2010	2.78	a	Not live prime time press conferences, not self-aggrandizing twitter hashtags and not quitting on his teammates during the playoffs.
2011	3.12	a	Let's see what the future holds for Lebron.
2012	3.0	a	We know he'll be rich, but how will he be viewed by fans across the country.
2013	2.88	a	Perhaps Lebron should have hired a  Chief Culture Officer along with his coterie of other advisors.
2014	3.1	a	If I were to fulfill that role for him, I would have told him to go low key with this decision and let it be led by his new team.
2015	2.78	a	He's also managed to surround himself with people who understand business, but I'm starting to wonder if he's lost a bit of understanding of American culture.
2016	3.4	a	Make sure it's clear that the team comes first and that he's looking forward to being part of the team.
2017	3.3	a	That the only thing that matters is winning a championship.
2018	3.0	a	That that was the main factor.
2019	3.0	a	Update:  Lebron chooses the Miami Heat and the similarities to A-Rod continue, with Dwyane Wade playing the role of Derek Jeter.
2020	2.75	a	Update 2: And so it begins...

2023	3.0	a	How soon is now? Lebron James Makes His Decision: The A-Rod Route 8 Jul 2010 by Rick
2024	3.0	a	He's a free agent now and tonight he made his decision about which team he's going to play for in a very public manner, with a live announcement on ESPN.
2025	3.44	a	Earlier this week Lebron jumped on Twitter and quickly gained a massive following.
2026	3.1	a	This morning he announced:
2027	3.0	a	Lebron James was of course a trending topic and that hashtag was burning as well.
2028	3.3	a	Lebron James is an extremely talented basketball player.
2029	2.67	a	But I'm starting to wonder if Lebron isn't painting himself into a corner, and has maybe misread how quickly sentiment can change.
2030	2.25	a	Can you imagine the baby seal crying out for fear as a sealer raises his club?
2031	3.0	a	Many of our critics say that you and I who love animals attribute intelligent and sensitive qualities to “stupid, non-feeling” animals.
2032	2.0	a	“stupid, non-feeling”
2033	2.7	a	But our ability to feel the fear and know the pain that animals experience is no “error in judgement” nor “overblown sentimentality”…it is real.
2034	3.0	a	“error in judgement” nor “overblown sentimentality”
2035	3.4	a	The International Fund for Animal Welfare is one of the largest, most effective animal welfare organizations in the world with a special mission to save animals’ lives, prevent cruelty, and protect natural habitat for wildlife to live and enjoy life in harmony with man.
2036	2.89	a	Dear Ms. LastName I wanted to personally write you and give you our 2001 Collectible Calendar and talk about animals in danger - a cause we both care deeply about.
2037	2.5	a	Whether we talk about clubbing baby seals to death for their beautiful pelts, or butchering elephants with hacksaws for their ivory, or trapping animals in steel-jaw leghold traps where the pain is so excruciating they have been known to chew off a leg to escape, we stand guard for all animals.
2038	3.4	a	Whether it is to fund additional land for the Addo elephant park in South Africa where 29 calves were born this year or our partnership with Future Generations to save vital habitat for moon bears, bengal tigers and other animals, or our response to move orphaned lions to 500 acres of protected African bush where they will live safely for the rest of their lives… we are committed to the concept of ANIMAL SANCTUARIES.
2039	3.17	a	I’m positive you agree with this most basic, humane approach.
2040	2.86	a	I won’t even ask if you support this program.
2041	3.1	a	but rather, I must ask how much you can afford to support this Animal Sanctuary Fund today?
2042	3.43	a	IFAW ANIMAL SANCTUARY FUND Your donation will help give an animal a safe home!
2043	2.5	a	I do not like to ask for money No one does.
2044	3.2	a	But money gives us the POWER TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE VOICELESS.
2045	2.9	a	Please take a moment to look over the enclosed 2001 Animal Sanctuary Calendar.
2046	3.8	a	Your gift will help give an animal a safe home.
2047	3.5	a	Be absolutely sure, your donations do save lives.
2048	3.38	a	Many people know us as the Save the Seals people and we have saved thousands of animals - seals, elephants, cats, dogs, bears, whales.
2049	3.2	a	This new program will be a huge success with your help.
2050	3.4	a	I thought you would enjoy our 2001 Animal Sanctuary Calendar.
2051	3.38	a	It is a unique gift to you for taking your time to hear my vision of new safety for the world’s animals and my request for your hard-earned money The simple fact is we cannot continue without your generous gifts.
2052	3.18	a	Gifts of $100, $25, and $15 all are important to keep our Animal Sanctuary Fund operating.
2053	3.1	a	Be sure to write me back to let me know your 2001 Calendar has arrived m good order.
2054	2.7	a	Please rush me your generous gift of $100 or $15 today while these endangered animals are on your mind and in your heart.
2055	3.0	a	Animals don’t ask for much of us.
2056	3.3	a	Your donation today could save a life tomorrow
2057	3.13	a	PS. Please enjoy the photographs of the animals you are so generously befriending.
2058	3.0	a	And please use the enclosed 2001 Calendar Reply when writing me back.
2059	3.4	a	I’m sure you will want to keep it and prominently display it to enjoy these striking wildlife images.
2060	3.09	a	Don’t you agree that the lion and baby seal are looking right into your eyes?
2061	3.75	a	And if you have ever experienced to sight of a diving dolphin, you will be brought instantly back to that exciting moment when turning to our August image.
2062	2.1	a	Can you imagine the lion on our calendar cover being cruelly killed for a hunter’s trophy?
2063	3.14	a	Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation.
2064	3.1	a	You can view artifacts from the Bronze Age, trace the history of the Easter Rising, or revisit Leopold Bloom’s odyssey in Ulysses.
2065	3.2	a	Old buildings are being recycled; for example, the 17th-century Royal Hospital now holds the Museum of Modern Art.
2066	2.7	a	New construction is everywhere, the streets buzz, traffic is increasingly congested, and in the frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in Dublin seems intent on changing places with everyone else.
2067	3.1	a	City on the Liffey
2068	3.1	a	The River Liffey flows from west to east through the center of the city to Dublin Bay.
2069	2.78	a	The river forms a natural line between the north and south sections of the city.
2070	3.0	a	Historically and culturally this north-south distinction has always been significant, and it still is today, with a dose of good-humored rivalry between the two areas.
2071	3.0	a	“ I never go north of the Liffey,” one man remarked.
2072	3.0	a	Farther out, both north and south, are the sweeping curves of the Royal and Grand Canals.
2073	3.33	a	The occasional cry of gulls and unexpected distant vistas will remind you that Dublin is by the sea, and the Wicklow mountains, which hold Dublin closely to the coast, are visible from everywhere.
2074	3.25	a	Dublin is an intimate city, physically small but tightly packed, a perfect place for walking.
2075	3.1	a	College Green, the home of Trinity College, provides a natural focus just south of the O’Connell Street bridge.
2076	3.0	a	O’Connell Street, the city’s grand boulevard, leads north to Parnell Square.
2077	3.1	a	It won’t rain on you in Dublin all the time.
2078	3.14	a	The climate here can best be described as “changeable” and yet the sudden shifts from light to dark, sunshine to shower, are part of the city’s magic.
2079	3.1	a	Buildings seem to transform themselves depending on the light; Dublin under a lowering sky is a different place from Dublin in sunshine.
2080	2.9	a	Joyce, the high priest of literary Modernism, imagined and interpreted Dublin for the world in Ulysses (you’ll see references to it all over).
2081	3.6	a	At night the streets are crowded with people bent on having a good time.
2082	2.8	a	Beckett and Joyce, among others, had to leave their homeland to understand it —  and to be understood.
2083	3.1	a	The city’s impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of U2 and Bob Geldof is well known — there’s even a self-guided tour of their haunts.
2084	3.5	a	Traditional Irish music is also alive and well, especially in the pubs, and there has been a revival of storytelling, poetry reading, and traditional dancing.
2085	3.43	a	And in this city, where literature and theater have historically dominated the scene, visual arts are finally coming into their own with the new Museum of Modern Art and the many galleries that display the work of modern Irish artists.
2086	3.38	a	Prosperity is in the air; the roar of the “Celtic Tiger” can clearly be heard.
2087	3.09	a	And while multinational chains have made inroads, they seem less blatant here than elsewhere.
2088	3.3	a	Many shops, and also hotels and guest houses, have been owned and managed by the same families for years, and theirs is the welcome of traditional Dublin hospitality.
2089	2.89	a	Dublin’s food has undergone a metamorphosis.
2090	2.71	a	There was a time when you might have apologized for it, but no longer.
2091	3.38	a	Dublin has international restaurants galore, and the New Irish Cuisine is built upon fresh products of Ireland’s seas, rivers, and farms.
2092	2.75	a	But this is not the whole picture.
2093	3.2	a	Coffee has replaced the ubiquitous tea — Dublin is now almost as much a coffee city as Vienna or Seattle.
2094	3.1	a	City and Countryside
2095	3.22	a	In a city of such human proportions it is not surprising that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation.
2096	3.29	a	Phoenix Park in the northwest is the largest open space, but squares like St. Stephen’s Green are the garden oases of the city.
2097	3.2	a	As capital of Europe’s most explosive economy, Dublin seems to be changing before your very eyes.
2098	3.25	a	On the coast, Sandymount, Dollymount, and Killiney strands are the places to go.
2099	3.29	a	The beautiful Wicklow Mountains, and the Wicklow Mountains National Park provide a more rugged countryside, and the area has breathtaking houses and gardens such as Castletown, Mount Usher, and Powerscourt.
2100	3.1	a	To the north and west are the ancient sites of Ireland: Malahide Castle, the evocative hill of Tara, and the long barrows of Knowth and Newgrange.
2101	3.0	a	This busy, modern European city sits on a thousand years of history — history is present everywhere, from elegant Merrion Square to the bullet holes on the General Post Office.
2102	3.0	a	The DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) runs north and south along the coast.
2103	3.12	a	It’s an ideal way for the visitor to reach outlying sights and villages.
2104	3.2	a	There are many guided bus tours to sights outside the city, and some are accessible by city bus.
2105	3.22	a	Young at Heart?
2106	3.44	a	The universities attract students from all over the world, and this influx helps to make Dublin a busy, buzzing international city.
2107	3.78	a	However, young and old, stranger and Dubliner rub shoulders quite happily.
2108	3.2	a	Religion and respect for parents has not yet gone out of fashion.
2109	3.5	a	Unemployment is at an all-time low.
2110	3.2	a	The Irish are actually beginning to come home.
2111	3.0	a	It’s also a city of the imagination, reinvented and reappraised in the literature of its exiles.
2112	3.4	a	And the old Dublin is with us, too — the irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar magic possessed by Ireland and the Irish.
2113	2.89	a	Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist enclave with its laws and rights intact, and China has promised that Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least 50 years.
2114	3.43	a	Beijing’s announced policy of maintaining Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability makes sense.
2115	2.9	a	But in fact, once news of the handover vanished from the front pages, the people of Hong Kong returned to their usual topics of conversation: the economy and the price of housing.
2116	3.0	a	The impression of the visitor today will be that very little has changed.
2117	2.9	a	Establishments are no longer called “Royal,” Queen Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage, and the Union Jack has been replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its bauhinia flower.
2118	3.12	a	But in fact, there have been changes, many of them due to economic progress, new construction, and other factors that influence cities all over the world.
2119	3.1	a	Others are more subtle.
2120	3.1	a	British social customs are still evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour.
2121	2.88	a	The British population has decreased; today there are as many American and Australian ex-pats as there are British.
2122	2.63	a	With a population of nearly eight million and a total area of just over 1,095 square km (423 square miles), housing is one of Hong Kong’s perennial nightmares.
2123	2.8	a	Hong Kong is crowded — it has one of the world’s greatest population densities.
2124	3.1	a	To alleviate the problem, the government has become the city’s major landlord with the construction of massive apartment blocks that, though they have every modern facility, average only 9 square m (100 square ft) in size.
2125	3.0	a	Hong Kong and Its People

2170	3.4	a	Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat.
2171	2.89	a	In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end.
2172	3.12	a	She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.”

2174	2.56	a	Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband.

2177	3.0	a	In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover.
2178	3.18	a	In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy.
2179	3.2	a	Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

2182	3.0	a	The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries.
2183	3.0	a	But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”.
2184	3.0	a	“Pagoda”
2185	3.4	a	Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man.

2188	2.9	a	Ibid., 53.
2189	2.9	a	Her dangerous sexuality is the key.
2190	3.1	a	Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre.
2191	2.75	a	It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness.
2192	3.25	a	In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful.
2193	3.29	a	Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”.

2199	3.0	a	Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal.
2200	3.1	a	In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.”
2201	2.7	a	“Eternal Prisoner,”
2202	2.5	a	“he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.”

2206	2.5	a	Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction.
2207	3.0	a	In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale.
2208	2.9	a	“Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”

2210	3.0	a	“Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,”
2211	2.64	a	“Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda”
2212	3.12	a	While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend.
2213	2.8	a	She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature.
2214	2.7	a	The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories.
2215	2.8	a	This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored.
2216	2.91	a	In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda.
2217	3.0	a	Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective.
2218	2.6	a	Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana.
2219	2.73	a	Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man.
2220	2.5	a	He is weak-willed and not particularly useful.
2221	2.8	a	In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you.
2222	2.6	a	“Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form”
2223	2.9	a	The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery.
2224	3.0	a	But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere?
2225	3.12	a	If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character.
2226	3.0	a	Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality.
2227	4.38	a	“I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,”
2228	3.4	a	“Lust.”
2229	2.5	a	Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her.
2230	3.0	a	She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together.
2231	4.0	a	“We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?”
2232	3.0	a	While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it.
2233	2.71	a	Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives.
2234	3.8	a	Wouldn’t that be wonderful?”
2235	2.4	a	“Eternal Prisoner,”
2236	3.09	a	“Eternal Prisoner,” 369.
2237	2.9	a	In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s.
2238	3.0	a	“Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ”
2239	2.7	a	So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight.
2240	2.6	a	However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda.
2241	3.0	a	In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending.

2529	3.0	a	With rising demand for the firm, oil-rich fish came pirate fishing fleets eager to cash in on its popularity -- even if it meant skirting catch limits and environmental regulations.
2530	2.89	a	Contrary to what some restaurants and retailers tell their customers, the U.S. government does not consider the Chilean seabass to be endangered.
2531	2.3	a	But in some areas, the seabass are being overfished.
2532	2.27	a	That is potentially a problem because Chilean seabass are a long-lived species -- living as long as 50 years -- and reproduce slowly, said Susan Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the federal government's National Marine Fisheries Service.
2533	2.9	a	"ATTENTION EDITORS: This article from the NEWHOUSE NEWS SERVICE report of TUESDAY, JULY 30, 2002, is available as a ""separate buy."""
2534	2.7	a	The NMFS estimates that in 2000, more than 16,000 tons of Chilean seabass were legally caught from an internationally regulated harvest area in the Antarctic Ocean.
2535	2.44	a	But more than 32,000 tons may have been taken illegally from those same waters, the fisheries service said.

2547	2.7	a	"The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reports that 47 percent to 50 percent of stocks are ""fully exploited,"" meaning that catches have either reached or are close to maximum limits."

2551	2.9	a	Rod Moore, executive director of the West Coast Seafood Processors Association, suggests that activists with an agenda are manipulating chefs and retailers.
2552	3.0	a	The conservation groups providing information to chefs and retailers and lists of environmentally appropriate seafoods to consumers are the same groups working to affect fisheries management on the political and regulatory level, Moore said.
2553	3.2	a	That's simply good strategy, said James Leape, deputy director of the conservation program for the David and Lucile Packard Foundation in Los Altos, Calif.
2554	3.5	a	In 2000 and 2001, the Packard Foundation awarded $26 million in marine fisheries conservation grants.
2555	3.2	a	They included support for marine reserves and money for fisheries management reform.

2562	2.67	a	But in a business in which 12-hour shifts are the norm, some chefs worry about their lack of time to stay informed about complicated, rapidly changing fisheries management issues.
2563	3.0	a	Some working chefs say they routinely review conservation group Web sites, government reports and industry sources.

2581	3.1	a	"The APA has spent more than $1 million to help state psychological associations develop and lobby for such prescription privileges -- or ""RxP"" -- legislation."
2582	3.0	a	A total of 31 state psychology associations have task forces dedicated to developing and lobbying for prescription-privileges legislation.
2583	3.0	a	The version endorsed by the APA would license doctoral-level psychologists to independently prescribe psychotropic drugs after completing 300 hours of classroom instruction in neuroscience, physiology and pharmacology, followed by four months' supervised treatment of 100 patients.
2584	3.0	a	Critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other prescribers, such as M.D. psychiatrists or nurse practitioners who have at least six years' medical education and clinical experience.
2585	3.0	a	Their greatest objection is to the notion of turning psychology into a prescribing profession.
2586	3.33	a	"In a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind, mood and behavior can be studied empirically, the past decade, Davison says, has seen ""exciting developments"" that demonstrate the validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the psychosocial-behavioral models on which they are based."

2609	3.2	a	"""This is a Silverplate request,"""
2610	3.0	a	Denise Gamino writes for the Austin (Texas) American-Statesman.
2611	3.0	a	Silverplate: code word for the historic mission that would end World War II.
2612	3.0	a	Almost 1,800 men were assembled n late 1944 to join the top-secret unit called the 509th Composite Group.
2613	3.38	a	A mission to end a war
2614	3.0	a	And the first person he chose to join him was Karnes, though he couldn't reveal the mission to Karnes.
2615	3.0	a	Karnes was Tibbets' adjutant, the man in charge of writing the orders and cajoling the transfer to the unit of servicemen proficient in bombing, mechanics, ordnance, engineering and communications.
2616	2.5	a	Tibbets hated paperwork.
2617	3.12	a	Karnes thought it was a breeze.
2618	3.0	a	They were a wartime match that changed the world.
2619	2.64	a	Japan surrendered within days of the detonation of the atomic bombs that killed 140,000 people in Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and 70,000 in Nagasaki three days later.
2620	2.88	a	The story of the 509th is a tale of an elite outfit that lived in a bubble of secrecy and endured the taunts of other war-weary U.S. units that resented sharing a small Pacific island with the 509th, which appeared exempt from combat.
2621	3.0	a	Karnes has never spoken publicly about his role as Tibbets' right-hand administrative aide.
2622	2.9	a	He never even told his story to students in his 40 years of teaching college.
2623	2.8	a	War is hell, he says, and when it was over, he wanted to come home and rejoin his young family and not dwell on it.
2624	3.0	a	He earned a doctorate in history from Stanford University and taught Latin American history at Tulane University and Arizona State University.
2625	2.9	a	Next week marks the 57th anniversary of the atomic bombings.
2626	3.12	a	"Each year on Aug. 6, ""I always think of Paul Tibbets and how he handled unbelievable responsibility,"" Karnes said."
2627	3.0	a	Karnes met Tibbets when the 29-year-old bomber pilot walked into Karnes' office at Wendover Army Air Field on the Utah-Nevada border.
2628	3.0	a	Karnes was the personnel and classification officer.
2629	3.12	a	He was only a captain, but he had been left in charge at Wendover the day Tibbets surprised them by landing a B-29, a new plane no one at Wendover had seen.
2630	2.9	a	He was searching for a remote installation to train bomber crews and support units in total secrecy.
2631	3.3	a	Tibbets instantly liked the isolation and vast size of Wendover and the surrounding Bonneville Salt Flats.
2632	3.1	a	In Karnes, Tibbets found a kindred spirit -- and a handball partner.
2633	3.0	a	Both were smart, disciplined, quiet men who thrived on efficiency, perfection and self-reliance.
2634	2.82	a	He was tracking down men to join a group so secret he couldn't admit it existed.
2635	2.6	a	"""I don't recall ever having to tell Tom to do anything,"""
2636	2.8	a	"""I don't recall ever having to tell Tom to do anything,"" Tibbets said in an e-mail this week."

2638	3.6	a	I was very lucky to have Tom.
2639	3.0	a	""""
2640	3.09	a	Tibbets quickly returned to Wendover after that first visit to set up his headquarters.
2641	2.9	a	His first order appointed Karnes adjutant for the 509th.
2642	3.0	a	Almost overnight, Wendover became a high-security base filled with off-limit areas covered in barbed wire.
2643	2.73	a	Karnes and his staff read outgoing mail to make sure no secrets slipped out.
2644	2.8	a	Karnes hated to pry, and skimmed over personal portions of the letters.
2645	2.44	a	Phone calls were monitored.
2646	2.73	a	Karnes knew the 509th was preparing for a special bombing mission, but he had no idea what kind of bombs were involved.
2647	3.1	a	"""I had a friend, the finance officer."

2650	3.3	a	"""mmm-mm,"""
2651	3.0	a	By spring, the 509th prepared to move to Tinian Island, near Guam and Saipan.
2652	2.9	a	That would put the B-29s about 1,500 miles from Japan -- a 13-hour round-trip flight.
2653	2.9	a	Karnes was deluged with orders for inoculations, equipment, transfers and promotions.
2654	3.0	a	He was calling bases all over the United States to line up their transfer to the desert outside Salt Lake City.
2655	3.0	a	Karnes arrived on Tinian on May 18, 1945, as part of an advance team that flew in the five C-54 transport planes of the 509th.
2656	3.09	a	On May 29, 1,200 men arrived on the troopship Cape Victory after a five-week trip from Seattle.
2657	3.0	a	Tinian Island had been captured from Japan, and the Seabees, the construction arm of the Navy, had built two large airfields.
2658	3.0	a	The 509th took North Field and stayed in relative isolation from other B-29 units on the island.
2659	3.0	a	Karnes handed out bunk assignments, choosing the mess officer, Chuck Perry, to share his tent.
2660	3.18	a	Karnes had his own Jeep, and went to the beach and to evening movies shown by other units as often as he could.
2661	2.8	a	Not until the day before Tibbets and his crew flew to Hiroshima was the 509th told what was happening.
2662	3.0	a	"The word spread: ""This is it."
2663	3.0	a	"""This is it."
2664	3.09	a	"This is the big mission."""
2665	3.0	a	Karnes and hundreds of other men from the 509th stood along the flight line as Tibbets and the Enola Gay took off at 2:45 a.m. on Aug. 6, a warm, tropical night.

2667	3.0	a	Three B-29s had gone ahead to check the weather at Hiroshima and two other possible bomb sites.
2668	2.86	a	Two other B-29s left in two-minute intervals after Tibbets so their crews could take photos and drop devices to measure radiation and other effects of the bomb.
2669	3.1	a	Tibbets got the word only an hour from Hiroshima that the city's weather was clear.
2670	2.78	a	As they approached, Tibbets braced for Japanese anti-aircraft fire.
2671	2.7	a	None came.
2672	2.5	a	"Early in the flight, the crew had inserted a plug of uranium into the 9,000-pound bomb, nicknamed ""Little Boy."
2673	2.8	a	Ninety seconds from the bomb drop, Tibbets put the plane on auto-pilot.
2674	2.7	a	The crew slipped on dark glasses to prepare for the blinding flash of the bomb.
2675	2.0	a	"At 8:15 a.m. Hiroshima time, the pneumatic bomb-bay doors opened and ""Little Boy,"" equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT, fell out."
2676	3.0	a	The Enola Gay climbed, and Tibbets fought to turn the plane in the air-bending, 155-degree the crews had been practicing off Tinian for months.
2677	3.0	a	He pushed off the dark glasses because he couldn't see to fly.
2678	3.0	a	"""Who says this?"""
2679	3.0	a	"""Who says this?"" another commanding officer asked Karnes."
2680	2.7	a	When the bomb exploded as planned 1,890 feet over Hiroshima, Tibbets' mouth tingled, and he tasted the lead fillings in his teeth.
2681	2.6	a	A minute later, the shock wave hit.
2682	2.3	a	The crew was horrified by the purple mushroom cloud that climbed to 10 miles and looked as if it would engulf the Enola Gay.
2683	2.5	a	More shocking was the city of Hiroshima, which was on fire and bubbling like tar.
2684	2.2	a	"""We were all appalled,"""
2685	2.9	a	Back on Tinian, Karnes had gone to bed.
2686	2.44	a	But he didn't sleep long.
2687	3.0	a	Someone woke him to say Gen. Hap Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forcesin Washington, was on the phone and asking for him.
2688	2.9	a	"Each time, Karnes said what he had to: ""Call Air Force headquarters if you don't believe me."""
2689	3.1	a	"Arnold told Karnes, ""Tibbets is going to be landing in three to four hours, and I want to give him the Distinguished Service Cross, and it is your job to write up the explanation."""

2694	2.7	a	"""Call Air Force headquarters if you don't believe me."""
2695	3.12	a	When an unsuspecting Tibbets descended from the Enola Gay on Tinian, he barely managed to palm his pipe as Gen. Carl Spaatz, commander of the Strategic Air Forces, stepped forward to pin the medal on his bomb flight coveralls.
2696	3.33	a	He knew the war would soon be over and he would be heading home.
2697	3.0	a	A yearof secrecy and hard work wasover.
2698	2.33	a	Three days later, another B-29 from the 509th bombed Nagasaki.
2699	2.5	a	"Today, Karnes is frustrated that some of his fellow historians, the ones he calls ""revisionists,"" question the wisdom and morality of the bombings."
2700	2.0	a	I have to warn you, though, you won’t like what I have to tell you.”
2701	3.0	a	Something in his tone couldn’t be disbelieved.
2702	3.0	a	“Tell me anyway.
2703	2.5	a	If she’s in trouble, I want to find her, wherever she is.”
2704	3.0	a	My driver took a deep breath.
2705	3.0	a	As he did, his neck stretched in a strange way and I noticed several thin lines, like wrinkles, running across the sides of his neck.
2706	3.0	a	“Nathan,”
2707	2.63	a	“Nathan,” he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation,

2712	3.1	a	Come on, I have something to show you.”
2713	2.9	a	With that, he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadn’t noticed before.
2714	2.78	a	Their bumpers looked ready to drop off, and their paint was half smog.
2715	2.43	a	I got a strange feeling that we weren’t supposed to be driving here.
2716	3.0	a	“Hey,”
2717	2.78	a	“Hey,” I said, “are you sure that we should be going this way?
2718	2.7	a	“are you sure that we should be going this way?

2720	2.71	a	“Just ignore that,” he told me.
2721	3.12	a	“You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment.”
2722	2.0	a	That just unnerved me more.
2723	3.25	a	My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to the clubs near our school.
2724	2.75	a	I noticed that there were some people on the street, people the same color as the soiled buildings.
2725	2.64	a	Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes.
2726	2.9	a	He parked and got out.
2727	2.6	a	“Is it really safe to leave the car …”
2728	2.75	a	Glancing back at that gleaming glare, I decided that it might be safer to follow the driver than to wait with the car.
2729	3.0	a	I hopped out, ran after him, and reached him just as he was knocking on the door.
2730	3.2	a	Sometimes we'd get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges, and we'd rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up.
2731	3.2	a	The ceiling was high and wooden, and I could see part of a DJ’s booth down the hall.
2732	3.0	a	It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub.
2733	3.0	a	Then I looked down and saw what had let us in.
2734	3.9	a	“Nice, my man,”
2735	3.73	a	“Nice, my man,” he said as they clasped hands.
2736	3.11	a	“This is someone from Ivan’s family.
2737	3.0	a	Did I ever tell you about them?”
2738	2.4	a	“Yeah, one time, man, but you were pretty fucked up.
2739	2.4	a	What’s your problem, kid?”
2740	2.56	a	His skin was brown and stretched, like some diseased sapling’s bark.
2741	2.62	a	It pulled back around his fingertips, which bore things that might have been nails or claws.
2742	2.86	a	When he grinned, I saw that his teeth were sharp and small, like a hunting cat’s.
2743	2.9	a	Under matted hair, his eyes had slit pupils.
2744	3.0	a	Nepthys quickly answered for me.
2745	2.3	a	“Girlfriend troubles.

2747	1.9	a	“Bummer.

2749	3.0	a	He turned to me.
2750	3.1	a	Nepthys nodded: “It’s okay, you can trust him.
2751	3.2	a	“It’s okay, you can trust him.

2761	3.12	a	“Oh, totally,”
2762	3.1	a	“I get that all the time around here.”
2763	3.0	a	“He was wearing a sort of jacket …maybe blue velvet, I couldn’t tell in the dark, but it had ruffles at the throat, things like that.
2764	2.8	a	That’s why I couldn’t understand why no-one else remembered him.
2765	2.8	a	I remember that he hardly ever moved, just stared at Rachel.
2766	3.0	a	Even when he talked, he hardly opened his mouth.
2767	2.8	a	I don’t know how he could’ve been heard over the music.”
2768	3.1	a	The two glanced at each other.
2769	3.0	a	“What do you think?”
2770	3.0	a	asked the hunchback.
2771	2.6	a	“I’ve looked into it a little, and I do think we might be dealing with one of them.
2772	3.0	a	Have you seen anyone like that in your club?”
2773	3.0	a	“Not that I can remember, man.
2774	3.0	a	I can send you to a guy who knows all about them, though.
2775	3.0	a	It was a Friday night.
2776	3.1	a	If this cat’s for real, I bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know.”
2777	3.86	a	“You’re a wonder, Dvorov.
2778	2.8	a	It won’t be long before nightfall.”
2779	3.57	a	“Oh yeah, man.
2780	3.0	a	Rachel and I went out to dinner, and when we finished, she saw that there was a message on her cell phone.
2781	3.0	a	Here, let me write down how to find him.”
2782	3.0	a	The hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail, then handed it to Nepthys.
2783	4.09	a	Good luck!”
2784	3.56	a	“Thanks, Dvorov.
2785	3.6	a	I owe you one.
2786	3.3	a	Let’s go.”
2787	2.8	a	That last one was to me.
2788	3.11	a	I waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left.
2789	2.9	a	He gave me a half-hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing, and whether I should be wearing body armor.
2790	3.2	a	Back on the street, I began to see things that I had never looked for until then.
2791	2.6	a	Still in my initial shock, I suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadn’t registered when we parked.
2792	2.25	a	The yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog: it had a leeching, heavy dimness.
2793	2.67	a	I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light.
2794	2.75	a	A corpulent, batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle.
2795	3.0	a	She checked it there in the restaurant.
2796	3.0	a	Leaning from the rough-hewn window of one building on our right was something with long, green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill.
2797	3.0	a	Thirty-five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed.
2798	2.78	a	I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards.
2799	2.75	a	“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,”
2800	3.0	a	“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver.
2801	3.0	a	Her head tilted into the phone as she listened, her pleather purse on her lap, shining jet against the worn black of her snug Dead Can Dance T-shirt.
2802	2.9	a	I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills.
2803	2.8	a	“We interact with humans, take advantage of them, grant them boons, sometimes even become their friends, but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction.
2804	3.0	a	“The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours.
2805	3.2	a	Love-ins, raves, gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion: that is where entities from this world tend to go when they cross over, and that is where Rachel met someone from this world.
2806	2.7	a	Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this, where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner, with the right protective spells.”
2807	2.88	a	He took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us.
2808	3.11	a	We should get started right away.
2809	3.0	a	There’s no time to waste.”
2810	3.0	a	Setting an arm on my shoulder, he said, “Nathan, what you see here might be frightening, but those things you saw are people just like you.
2811	3.1	a	They’ll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms.”
2812	3.43	a	“Thanks.
2813	3.2	a	It’s very reassuring that I’ll not only be an outsider but a curiosity.”
2814	2.8	a	“Nathan, you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help Rachel.
2815	3.1	a	Well, she’s here and she needs your help.
2816	3.11	a	Now, the more we can do before nightfall, the better.”
2817	2.88	a	“But why are you even helping me?
2818	3.2	a	Until thirty seconds ago, I didn’t believe in magic or any of that kind of …weirdness.”
2819	3.0	a	“Nathan, I told you: my family owes yours a debt.
2820	3.14	a	In this world, one’s word is a promise.
2821	2.5	a	Now, can we get going?”
2822	3.0	a	“He says we should meet him tonight, there’s a good one going on in that church that closed down last month.”
2823	2.75	a	“Only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name.”
2824	3.1	a	Let’s go.”
2825	3.1	a	As we headed down the sidewalk, I said, “What is your name, anyway?”
2826	3.1	a	“What is your name, anyway?”
2827	3.0	a	What you may call me is Nepthys.”
2828	3.0	a	Holding Dvorov’s directions, Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway.
2829	2.4	a	I started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were.
2830	3.0	a	“Just at this corner,”
2831	3.0	a	“Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east.
2832	2.8	a	“we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east.
2833	3.0	a	East is that way.”
2834	3.0	a	He pointed at the wall to our right.
2835	2.8	a	“Don’t let the sun fool you.
2836	3.0	a	Then I’m going to shed a little blood, but don’t worry, none of yours.”
2837	2.9	a	I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner.
2838	3.0	a	“Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left.
2839	2.89	a	Try to keep in time with me.”
2840	2.6	a	We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust.
2841	2.6	a	The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back.
2842	2.9	a	When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner.
2843	2.78	a	Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door.
2844	3.0	a	“Are you coming?”
2845	3.0	a	We slipped through the door and came out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town.
2846	3.0	a	The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East.
2847	2.5	a	I’m not sure I’m up for a night out.”
2848	3.0	a	Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs.
2849	3.1	a	Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place.
2850	3.29	a	The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar.
2851	3.1	a	I was feeling calm and private that night.
2852	3.2	a	“Would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs?”
2853	3.0	a	it asked.
2854	3.11	a	“There are no finer to spice a meal, nor purer to mix a potion.
2855	2.67	a	It seemed like tonight’s darkness was small and personal, cupped hands offering a place for two, not the burning, open darkness of a rave.
2856	3.29	a	Please, let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs.”
2857	2.89	a	“We’re not here to browse,”
2858	2.67	a	“We’re not here to browse,” Nepthys told him.
2859	2.18	a	The thing frowned.
2860	3.4	a	“We have many fine cloves of garlic here on the cart, gentle sir.
2861	2.9	a	If – ”
2862	3.14	a	“You know what I mean.
2863	3.1	a	I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons.”
2864	2.8	a	It hissed thoughtfully.
2865	3.1	a	“True, true.
2866	3.0	a	Step behind the cart and enter through the door there, using your left hand to open the door and your right – ”
2867	3.14	a	Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart.
2868	3.0	a	The latch opened under Nepthys’ left hand with a clack!
2869	2.9	a	The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs.
2870	2.86	a	The room held a bed, a bookcase, and a desk with one chair.
2871	3.0	a	Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls.
2872	2.9	a	I smelled matted hair and cedar chips.
2873	2.9	a	He opened one eye when we came in but did not move.
2874	3.1	a	“We’re here for information about a vampire,”
2875	3.0	a	“We’re here for information about a vampire,” said Nepthys.
2876	1.9	a	“Oh, shit!”
2877	3.0	a	I said.
2878	2.4	a	“Sorry, kid.
2879	3.0	a	–Would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual?”
2880	2.8	a	“Wait, Nepthys – you said nothing about vampires.
2881	2.71	a	Frankly, I don’t know if we can even doing anything against a vampire.
2882	2.7	a	There’s an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are.
2883	2.5	a	Are …look, are they as bad as people in my world think they are?”
2884	3.56	a	It’s been over a week, and I want to dance.
2885	2.56	a	“I don’t know.
2886	2.44	a	“Only unsuccessfully, right?”
2887	2.87	a	“No, those people don’t usually leave stories.”
2888	2.88	a	So they’re probably worse than we think, okay, that’s great.
2889	2.9	a	Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel?”
2890	3.56	a	Let’s go together, you know you’ll have fun once you get into it.”
2891	2.4	a	“My plan is that you shut up while we’re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we’re actually going up against.
2892	2.91	a	Okay?
2893	2.9	a	Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman.
2894	2.91	a	"It came in through my mother's blood; my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories, bylichkas, of ancestors with the ""second sight"", stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks, and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times."
2895	3.0	a	Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed, who had not moved.
2896	2.4	a	“Please, accept our apologies.
2897	3.09	a	As you can see, our situation is of personal importance to the young man.
2898	2.55	a	The little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden room’s tight air.
2899	2.75	a	Finally, in a pinched rasp, he said, “My information is purely for the purposes of a collector.
2900	3.25	a	“My information is purely for the purposes of a collector.
2901	2.88	a	I do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm.”
2902	2.8	a	“Sir, we simply want to discover whether this individual is, in fact, a vampire.
2903	3.54	a	If there is any boon that you would have us do in return, we would be glad to do it.”
2904	2.7	a	He continued to lie in place, still breathing heavily.
2905	2.8	a	I tried to keep myself calm.
2906	3.0	a	“I have need of a certain stone that I once possessed.
2907	3.2	a	It would allow me to leave this bed, despite my current illness.
2908	2.6	a	My problem is that it was not made in this realm, but by a human, and only a human may handle it.
2909	3.0	a	“Of course we will fetch you the stone,” Nepthys assured him.
2910	2.9	a	Outside, the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone.
2911	2.91	a	Instead, it looked like we were in the red-light district: women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys.
2912	2.7	a	Nepthys didn’t need to warn me not to speak to them.
2913	3.22	a	“Okay, Rachel.
2914	3.0	a	He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under G d’s light, and handcuffed.
2915	3.0	a	Let’s go, you’re probably right.”
2916	3.1	a	Inside, the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions.
2917	2.6	a	Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive.
2918	3.5	a	“Good evening, gentlemen,”
2919	3.63	a	“Good evening, gentlemen,” she said.
2920	3.11	a	“May I invite you to have a cup of tea?”
2921	3.7	a	She grinned and gave me a kiss across the table, her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing, not just pressing your face into someone else’s.
2922	2.8	a	“No, thank you,”
2923	2.5	a	“No, thank you,” said Nepthys, “we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer.
2924	3.0	a	“we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer. Are you the proprietor of this shop?”
2925	3.0	a	Are you the proprietor of this shop?”
2926	3.4	a	“Yes,”
2927	3.29	a	“Yes,” answered the woman.
2928	3.29	a	“I am Madame Entera, at your service.
2929	2.9	a	She raised an eyebrow.
2930	3.0	a	Please, walk this way.”
2931	3.0	a	She led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like African tribesmen.
2932	3.25	a	The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome, with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd, floppy hats on the other.
2933	3.0	a	After this, we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside.
2934	2.9	a	“Excuse me,”
2935	3.0	a	“but may I ask what is kept in these rooms?”
2936	3.86	a	The woman laughed.
2937	3.2	a	“Why, the merchandise, of course,”
2938	3.14	a	Nepthys leaned close to my ear.
2939	2.37	a	“This is a slave shop,”
2940	2.12	a	“This is a slave shop,” he explained quietly.
2941	3.0	a	The woman paused before another door, this one not barred but locked.
2942	3.0	a	As she brought out the key, she said, “We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items.
2943	3.0	a	“We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items.
2944	3.22	a	We’ve had genies, indentured sorcerers, even golems and the occasional elf.
2945	3.0	a	This is one of the stranger items, though.
2946	3.0	a	It’s been in our collection for several years because only a human can activate it.
2947	2.57	a	If we only had a human on our staff, we could have done so ages ago and sold it off, but we have no such luck.”
2948	3.09	a	“Here it is,”
2949	3.0	a	“Here it is,” she said.
2950	3.0	a	With a flourish, she opened the door to reveal a room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire, intricate patterns like a Czar’s jewelry box crawling down the walls.
2951	2.83	a	“Let’s not get fucked up tonight, though, okay, Rache?
2952	3.5	a	“A marvel, isn’t it?”
2953	3.0	a	she said.
2954	3.67	a	“That such a rock could hold so much magic – it’s a wonder.”
2955	3.0	a	“That it is,”
2956	3.0	a	“That it is,” Nepthys assured her.
2957	3.0	a	“What would convince you to part with it?”
2958	3.0	a	“You wouldn’t give me the human, would you?
2959	2.5	a	No,
2960	2.29	a	No,”
2961	2.75	a	“that would make the stone rather useless.”
2962	3.4	a	Nevertheless, she gave me what I can only describe as an “appraising glance”.
2963	3.3	a	“appraising glance”
2964	3.86	a	I have never felt so appraised in all my life.
2965	3.6	a	“He looks healthy,”
2966	3.0	a	“He looks healthy,” she said, “how about a pint of his blood?”
2967	2.82	a	I have his health to consider.”
2968	3.0	a	Nepthys turned to me.
2969	3.14	a	“Sure, babe.
2970	2.6	a	“As if I wanted it,”
2971	2.44	a	“As if I wanted it,” interrupted the woman.
2972	3.3	a	“I think it’s a fair deal, considering the return,” he told me, “but it’s up to you.”
2973	3.0	a	“but it’s up to you.”
2974	2.27	a	Come on, I don’t have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself.
2975	3.09	a	I thought about it, then nodded.
2976	4.0	a	“Marvelous!” cried the woman.
2977	2.7	a	“One half-pint of human blood, willingly given, and his fine head of hair for the stone.”
2978	3.0	a	She took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping.
2979	3.0	a	Soon, she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl, which she put on the table beside me.
2980	3.0	a	“Roll up your sleeves,”
2981	3.0	a	“Roll up your sleeves,” she told me.
2982	3.1	a	She opened the bowl and carefully, gingerly brought out a fat, dripping leech.
2983	3.0	a	It must have been larger than my finger.
2984	3.2	a	She laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm.
2985	2.73	a	The cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker-mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow, where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin.
2986	2.63	a	Let’s not waste any more time.”
2987	2.9	a	“They take about a quarter-pint each,”
2988	3.0	a	“They take about a quarter-pint each,” said Madame Entera, drawing out another skinny leech.
2989	3.14	a	“They’re quick, too.
2990	3.3	a	Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber.
2991	3.1	a	She stood up and I followed her out to the street.
2992	3.3	a	At least the barber hadn’t nicked me.
2993	2.9	a	“Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it,”
2994	2.88	a	“Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it,” the woman admonished Nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him.
2995	3.9	a	“Thank you for doing business at our house, and I hope to see you again!”
2996	3.18	a	“Come on,” said Nepthys, “you could use a drink.”
2997	3.2	a	It was dark enough that I could actually see a few stars through the screen of city light.
2998	3.0	a	“you could use a drink.”
2999	3.12	a	We hit a bar on the next street over.
3000	3.1	a	“Vodka, straight up,”
3001	3.0	a	“Vodka, straight up,” Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter, “and a Bloody Mary for my friend.
3002	3.1	a	“and a Bloody Mary for my friend.
3003	3.0	a	Make it extra bloody.”
3004	2.7	a	When our drinks came, he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary.
3005	3.4	a	“That should help,”
3006	3.1	a	“That should help,” he said.
3007	3.1	a	“You could run on empty with a little of that stuff.
3008	3.12	a	It won’t refill your blood supply, but while that’s in your system, you won’t even need blood.”
3009	3.9	a	He grinned at me.
3010	3.12	a	“Drink up, kid.”
3011	3.0	a	I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery.
3012	2.6	a	Nepthys slapped me on the back.
3013	2.88	a	“Okay,”
3014	3.0	a	“Okay,” I said, “now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?
3015	2.9	a	“now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?
3016	3.0	a	He thought about that.
3017	2.62	a	“I think that our world is a reflection of yours, or yours is a more boring reflection of ours.
3018	3.1	a	Without hearing the car horns, I could almost taste the air of late March through the street fumes.
3019	3.0	a	This place is just a little of both.
3020	2.9	a	In America, things are still weird after the European conquest.
3021	2.88	a	The natives are still here, but so is everyone else.
3022	2.86	a	The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities.
3023	2.9	a	We aren’t quite what you’d expect from reading the Grimms.”
3024	3.0	a	“What do you mean?”
3025	3.1	a	He caught the bartender’s eye for another shot.
3026	2.7	a	Here, they’re the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the ‘gritty ambience’ – you have them in your world, too, right?
3027	2.7	a	Except it’s worse here because they have centuries to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous elements of society’s lowest rungs.
3028	3.0	a	Some of them actually commit to this society, though.
3029	3.75	a	There’s an amazing DJ who’s an elf.
3030	2.91	a	He has a real ear for it.
3031	3.2	a	If it was March, that meant that we’d been together almost a year and a half.
3032	3.7	a	“I am glad to be out of the favor-trading scene for half a minute.
3033	2.78	a	It’s exhausting to talk to those people.
3034	2.5	a	One wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something.
3035	3.0	a	So what else do you want to know, Nathan?”
3036	3.0	a	“I don’t know …hey, what about the nature spirits, things like that?
3037	2.89	a	I mean, where do the dryads fit in a place like this?”
3038	2.6	a	“If the tree isn’t around, the dryad isn’t around.
3039	3.14	a	It’s as simple as that.”
3040	1.89	a	That made me a little sad.
3041	3.3	a	They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school.
3042	3.0	a	“Well, what about you?
3043	3.11	a	“My parents came over from Russia, just like your family.
3044	2.62	a	My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate, but we don’t toss those around in this place.
3045	3.1	a	It was last February, after the winter break, that we moved in together.
3046	3.0	a	They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary.
3047	2.9	a	When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected.
3048	2.86	a	Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.”
3049	2.91	a	He took another shot of vodka.
3050	2.89	a	“Shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka?
3051	3.0	a	I mean, we might have a lot of work ahead of us.”
3052	2.4	a	“Are you kidding?
3053	3.1	a	Now spring was back, under the concrete, and I could smell it even here.
3054	3.0	a	We should get going, though.
3055	2.62	a	Still woozy?”
3056	3.0	a	I nodded.
3057	3.1	a	“A little walking should get the stuff into your system.
3058	3.2	a	Come on, let’s go.”
3059	3.0	a	As we left the bar, I asked to see the rock.
3060	2.38	a	“Why?”
3061	3.0	a	Nepthys asked.
3062	3.11	a	“I’m just curious.
3063	2.75	a	Don’t worry, I’ll be careful not to touch it.”
3064	3.37	a	I undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that I could see the stone inside.
3065	3.1	a	It looked like a normal river stone, a gray oval with a white stripe through it.
3066	2.75	a	As long as I looked at it, it didn’t reveal any magic sparkle or glow.
3067	2.62	a	Suddenly, what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me.
3068	2.8	a	I almost tripped over him, and the stone went flying out of the pouch.
3069	3.0	a	Nepthys tried to grab it, but, by reflex, I caught it first.
3070	3.6	a	“Isn’t it an amazing night, Rache?
3071	2.1	a	Immediately, I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid.
3072	3.2	a	“I agree,” I told him.
3073	3.2	a	The stone was as warm as human flesh now, and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stone’s soft heat, I don’t know.
3074	3.8	a	Even the city feels alive when spring comes.”
3075	3.4	a	Then there was light, a kind of rosy glow, and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air.
3076	3.2	a	The air around me seemed to still sound, and light came in around the corners of my eyes.
3077	2.6	a	I shouted, hardly able to hear myself.
3078	3.0	a	Nepthys was saying something that looked like, “I have no idea!”
3079	2.5	a	“I have no idea!”
3080	2.7	a	The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in, converging on the rosy glow around the stone, and for a moment I was blind.
3081	3.09	a	“Taxi!”
3082	2.6	a	There was no sign of the stone.
3083	3.09	a	She waved down a car and pulled me in.
3084	3.5	a	The girl was as soft and rosy as the stone’s glow, and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a Celtic knot.
3085	2.8	a	When she didn’t move, I knelt down and put a hand to her brow.
3086	3.1	a	As soon as I touched her, her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist.
3087	3.0	a	In a few minutes, we were getting out a block down from the abandoned church.
3088	2.1	a	I couldn’t move.
3089	3.0	a	“Name me,” she said.
3090	2.7	a	I opened my mouth to ask for an explanation, but Nepthys stopped me.
3091	2.7	a	“Don’t name her ‘What did you say?’, okay?
3092	3.0	a	‘What did you say?’
3093	3.0	a	The next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what she’ll respond to until we figure out how to put her back.”
3094	2.0	a	I was at a loss.
3095	3.3	a	I thought back to one time when I’d been thinking about raising a family and remembered that I’d always liked the name –
3096	2.91	a	“Amy.”
3097	3.14	a	Nepthys looked at me incredulously.
3098	3.11	a	“You awaken a magical being of unknown power from an enchanted stone, having purchased her with your own blood from a slave dealer, and you name her ‘Amy’?”
3099	3.8	a	Amy smiled at me and let go of my arm, but not before she brought my fingers to her lips and gave them one soft kiss.
3100	3.88	a	After she paid the driver, she grabbed my arm, laughing, and we ran down the street.
3101	3.2	a	I stood up and Amy stood with me.
3102	2.75	a	“I suppose so,” said Nepthys, “and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up.”
3103	2.3	a	“and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up.”
3104	3.12	a	We walked back to the herb stand.
3105	2.7	a	The vendor stared a little at Amy, his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp, but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs.
3106	2.57	a	When Nepthys opened the little man’s door, he rolled over and grinned to see us, but when Amy walked in, he blanched.
3107	3.1	a	“What!”
3108	2.22	a	“You idiots!
3109	2.75	a	You woke it up?
3110	3.0	a	“But …but sir,” I said, “are you sure she’s no help to you?”
3111	3.0	a	“are you sure she’s no help to you?”
3112	2.25	a	“Not if you named it already, you ninny, and I’m sure that you have!
3113	3.1	a	I heard the pulse already.
3114	2.25	a	Fools!
3115	2.12	a	Get out of my sight now – unless you know how to put it back?
3116	2.73	a	…I thought as much.
3117	2.4	a	Now leave, before I call the rats on you.”
3118	2.9	a	We left.
3119	2.3	a	Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck.
3120	4.1	a	We slammed against the doorway and I was laughing too, the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up vibrations in my chest, Rachel in my arms because she’d used me to soften her landing.
3121	1.88	a	“You idiot,”
3122	2.2	a	“do you know how much you’ve set us back?
3123	3.1	a	I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts.
3124	2.88	a	“You’re just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact.
3125	3.0	a	Come on, we’re heading out.”
3126	3.1	a	ome on, we’re heading out.”
3127	3.4	a	He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs.
3128	2.9	a	“Night comes quickly here,”
3129	2.44	a	“Didn’t I warn you?”
3130	3.0	a	“Okay,”
3131	3.3	a	“Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine.
3132	3.1	a	“we’re going to see another friend of mine.
3133	2.4	a	You look ridiculous with a shaved head.”
3134	3.14	a	At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston.
3135	2.89	a	It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front.
3136	2.89	a	“Dead Can Dance”
3137	3.0	a	Amy liked it, I think.
3138	3.0	a	He took us to a squat, long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal.
3139	3.0	a	The black door opened as we came up to it, and a pale man opened the door.
3140	3.3	a	He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth.
3141	2.82	a	I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity.
3142	2.82	a	His eyes were white.
3143	3.0	a	“A Forest”
3144	3.0	a	“I’m here to see Isis.
3145	3.0	a	Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her.”
3146	3.0	a	The man closed his eyes.
3147	2.9	a	Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up, taking Amy’s small hand so that she wouldn’t lag behind.
3148	2.0	a	I shivered as I walked past the pale man’s blank eyes, wondering what they were staring at.
3149	3.4	a	Amy gave my hand a squeeze.
3150	3.0	a	Then there was a door, which opened as we approached.
3151	3.0	a	Inside, the space opened into a wide, square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size.
3152	2.3	a	The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ’s toolkit and his beer.
3153	3.0	a	“Nepthys!”
3154	3.14	a	said the woman, slithering up across the furs to sit up.
3155	2.89	a	I had an urge to cover Amy’s eyes.
3156	3.64	a	“It’s been years since I’ve seen you.
3157	3.29	a	Please, come and sit beside me, and introduce your friends.”
3158	2.9	a	“This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,”
3159	3.0	a	“This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,” said Nepthys, ushering us toward the woman in silk.
3160	3.4	a	“The girl is …surprising,”
3161	3.4	a	“The girl is …surprising,” he concluded.
3162	2.7	a	“And I am Isis,”
3163	3.0	a	“And I am Isis,” said the woman, offering her hand to me.
3164	3.5	a	“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,”
3165	3.9	a	“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,” I said.
3166	3.8	a	She laughed, liquid, alluring, alarming.
3167	4.0	a	“Oh, precious!
3168	3.4	a	He has lovely manners, Nepthys, despite his poor taste in hats.
3169	3.0	a	You may leave out the ‘Lady,’ boy.
3170	2.5	a	I don’t wish to be reminded of how old I actually am.”
3171	3.3	a	A wave to the pale men brought a bottle of red wine and a platter of grapes.
3172	2.9	a	Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they’d taken down the crucifix.
3173	3.3	a	I hope I can start by offering some wine.”
3174	3.1	a	I asked.
3175	2.3	a	“I still feel a little woozy.”
3176	3.11	a	He poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me.
3177	3.37	a	The wine’s rich scent had a touch of something chemical that I recognized from the bar, but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth.
3178	3.0	a	Does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved?”
3179	3.0	a	“It was part of the price for this girl, who was a rock at the time,”
3180	3.29	a	“I have a feeling that she was worth the trade,”
3181	3.29	a	“I have a feeling that she was worth the trade,” I added.
3182	4.1	a	Amy, still holding my hand, smiled.
3183	3.0	a	“She may be at that,”
3184	3.82	a	“That sweet, small nose, and her soft lips – she’d kiss well, I should think, if gently.
3185	3.25	a	A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ’s moving sermon.
3186	3.22	a	She has good blood under her cheeks.
3187	2.86	a	Amy didn’t blush, and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying.
3188	2.7	a	“She would have been worth it,” Nepthys interrupted, “if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact.
3189	2.3	a	“if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact.
3190	3.2	a	He was going to give us valuable information for her.”
3191	3.12	a	“Now I understand why you’re here,”
3192	3.2	a	“Now I understand why you’re here,” said Isis.
3193	3.0	a	“So what do you need to know?”
3194	2.9	a	“You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way,”
3195	2.8	a	“You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way,” said Nepthys apologetically.
3196	3.5	a	“Mmm,”
3197	3.0	a	I couldn’t tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant.
3198	2.7	a	“I think that the person who stole the girl we’re looking for might be a vampire.
3199	3.1	a	“I do.
3200	3.0	a	Describe this one to me.
3201	2.78	a	If not, you’ll have to bring me something to work with.”
3202	3.12	a	Nepthys looked at me.
3203	3.0	a	I thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin, his dark hair, the way that light seemed to flow around him, as best as I could.
3204	3.1	a	Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full, hanging breasts.
3205	2.86	a	“You do?”
3206	2.71	a	Nepthys could hardly believe her.
3207	4.3	a	“That’s amazing!”
3208	3.0	a	“It is.
3209	3.11	a	He should be.
3210	2.6	a	I hope that you can do a better job than the last lot.”
3211	3.2	a	She sat up, running her hands along her pale, round thighs.
3212	3.0	a	“All right, then.
3213	3.0	a	Let me see if I can find him.”
3214	3.0	a	Isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands.
3215	2.9	a	A dark glow coalesced around her palms.
3216	3.55	a	Amy leaned forward, looking amazed.
3217	2.75	a	The dark glow grew stronger and larger, filling the air for about a foot around her hands.
3218	3.2	a	Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling’s blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd.
3219	2.5	a	In her palms, the droplets of blood swelled into small pools.
3220	2.8	a	The dark glow began to flicker, and Isis’ frown of concentration became one of worry.
3221	3.0	a	The pools in her hands grew deeper.
3222	2.9	a	She didn’t shed a bead of sweat, and I didn’t even see her draw a breath, but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame.
3223	2.8	a	Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake.
3224	2.6	a	Shivers swept through her body, and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him.
3225	2.7	a	‘Is she all right?’
3226	2.43	a	Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out, splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs.
3227	2.6	a	Isis collapsed on the fur, strings cut.
3228	2.9	a	“Isis, what happened?
3229	2.9	a	She shook her head, rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something.
3230	3.0	a	asked Nepthys.
3231	2.9	a	She rolled onto her back, her arms crossed tightly over her chest.
3232	2.7	a	For the first time, she looked vulnerable.
3233	3.0	a	When she finally spoke, I had to lean close to hear her.
3234	3.1	a	“I found your vampire,”
3235	2.7	a	“I found your vampire,” she said, “but he might know that someone’s looking for him.
3236	2.6	a	He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden.
3237	3.0	a	You should look for him at Dvorov’s as quickly as you can.”
3238	2.9	a	She turned to me with tired sympathy.
3239	2.8	a	“I didn’t see a girl with him.
3240	3.0	a	I stood, and one of her servants took me and Amy to the door.
3241	3.1	a	I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her.
3242	3.0	a	He stood to go, but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment.
3243	2.7	a	There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames.
3244	3.0	a	I turned back to the door.
3245	3.2	a	“Come on, Amy,” I said, “he’ll be along soon.”
3246	3.0	a	Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall.
3247	2.89	a	When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood.
3248	2.9	a	He offered it to Nepthys, who opened the box: on velvet lining, a wooden hammer and two stakes.
3249	3.0	a	“Mountain ash,”
3250	2.88	a	“Mountain ash,” said Nepthys.
3251	3.62	a	“That was very kind of her.”
3252	3.2	a	Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me.
3253	2.86	a	“I really hope we find your Rachel,”
3254	3.25	a	“I really hope we find your Rachel,” he said.
3255	3.4	a	“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,”
3256	2.86	a	“I bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me.”
3257	3.0	a	The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart.
3258	3.8	a	“Yo, my man Nep!
3259	3.1	a	You got the sucker already?”
3260	3.0	a	“No, but we got a tip that he might be in your club.
3261	3.0	a	Have you seen him?”
3262	3.1	a	“Here, man?
3263	2.57	a	You’re crazy.
3264	2.8	a	I haven’t had a vampire here since you and – ” Nepthys shot a wicked look at him.
3265	2.9	a	“Anyway, long time, man.”
3266	3.5	a	On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air.
3267	3.0	a	Do you mind if we check it out anyway?
3268	3.0	a	I have a real feeling that he’s in here somewhere.”
3269	2.44	a	Dvorov glanced over his shoulder, a little nervous.
3270	3.0	a	“I guess, man, but be quick.
3271	2.4	a	I don’t want my customers thinkin’ that anything’s wrong, you know?”
3272	3.0	a	We’ll be in and out in a minute.”
3273	3.1	a	Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards the dance floor.
3274	3.0	a	Dvorov asked us.
3275	3.0	a	“No, he said that his research was purely academic, not for hunters.”
3276	2.11	a	“Bummer.
3277	2.25	a	I guess I probably should’ve known, though.
3278	2.9	a	I mean, he is kinda tight about that stuff.”
3279	3.6	a	Good luck.”
3280	3.0	a	Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd, which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before.
3281	3.1	a	Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking.
3282	2.9	a	I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes.
3283	2.88	a	I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd.
3284	2.38	a	My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat.
3285	3.25	a	The music began to build, and a strobe came on.
3286	2.6	a	Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor, I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing – for a second, I was back with my family in Russia, hiding from the cold.
3287	3.1	a	I gathered her under my arm.
3288	3.1	a	Dvorov was somewhere behind me, too, negotiating delicately through his patrons.
3289	2.71	a	Just in front of me, a massive thing slammed into the wall, sending up a cloud of granite dust.
3290	3.2	a	Its haunches twitched in time to the music.
3291	2.88	a	As it started to rise, a man with thick, scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him.
3292	3.0	a	She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd.
3293	3.2	a	I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor.
3294	3.0	a	Holding Amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers, I started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this.
3295	2.73	a	A cold thing with countless, writhing tentacles fell against me, thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose, tripping me and clutching at my limbs.
3296	3.0	a	A woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me, fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing.
3297	2.44	a	Then a looming shape to my right fell away, and I saw him in a flash of the strobe, his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd.
3298	3.12	a	The creature blocking my vision moved back, but I had seen all that I needed to see.
3299	2.7	a	A bleeding, eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me, but I ducked around it and toward the bar.
3300	3.0	a	When she hadn’t come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar.
3301	2.3	a	I slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before, a mountain of wet, veined flesh, and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm.
3302	2.9	a	It was Dvorov.
3303	2.8	a	He pulled my ear down to his mouth.
3304	2.7	a	“You seen enough, man?”
3305	3.5	a	“Yes,”
3306	3.4	a	“Yes,” I called back, “I saw him!
3307	3.0	a	“I saw him!
3308	3.0	a	He’s sitting right there at the bar!”
3309	2.6	a	Dvorov tried to peek through the crowd, but it had shifted again and we couldn’t see a thing.
3310	2.8	a	“I don’t think he’s there,”
3311	2.4	a	“It must have been wishful thinking.”
3312	2.7	a	“No, I saw him!
3313	2.62	a	I have to hurry, too!
3314	3.0	a	Who knows how long he’ll stick around?”
3315	2.7	a	“Listen, man, he’s not there!
3316	2.3	a	I’m telling you, it’s not even worth checking the bar!”
3317	2.33	a	I turned to keep going, but he caught my arm again.
3318	2.36	a	“Don’t do this, kid!
3319	3.1	a	It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer.
3320	2.38	a	It’s a dumb idea.
3321	2.7	a	Even if you did find this vampire cat, he’d tear you apart!
3322	2.0	a	Suddenly, Amy screamed.
3323	2.71	a	I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away.
3324	2.75	a	He shot back up, hardly touching the ground, and I kicked him back.
3325	2.9	a	He jumped at my arm while I was still off-balance, and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that it’s too late to save itself.
3326	2.2	a	On the floor was Dvorov’s head, separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood.
3327	2.8	a	Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand.
3328	2.7	a	It flashed in the strobe where it wasn’t streaked with Dvorov’s blood.
3329	3.1	a	“He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two,”
3330	2.8	a	“He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two,” he said by way of explanation.
3331	3.2	a	“You spotted our boy, didn’t you?
3332	3.0	a	I bet his hide-out is nearby, too.
3333	3.1	a	Let’s hurry.”
3334	2.9	a	Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn’t see anyone else there.
3335	2.8	a	The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us.
3336	3.2	a	In a blink of the strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from the room.
3337	2.75	a	“Come on!”
3338	3.2	a	shouted Nepthys.
3339	2.62	a	He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held.
3340	3.1	a	Luckily, the vampire turned off after three stories.
3341	3.0	a	He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors, but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me.
3342	3.0	a	Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment.
3343	3.1	a	Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room, then made a turn out of sight.
3344	2.6	a	When I came to the door at the end of the room, it looked like it had been torn off its hinges.
3345	2.44	a	I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him.
3346	3.1	a	A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral.
3347	3.0	a	The vault rose into obscurity above me, and a massive rose window stood ahead of me.
3348	3.0	a	Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere.
3349	2.71	a	"When I asked her if she'd ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean – she would always look sad and tell me, ""No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us."
3350	2.75	a	I couldn’t tell how many people were running, much less where they were.
3351	2.9	a	On the steps in front of the altar, I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women.
3352	3.2	a	He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn’t see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable.
3353	2.9	a	Then I heard Nepthys shout, “Nathan!
3354	3.27	a	“Nathan!
3355	2.8	a	Behind you!”
3356	2.8	a	I whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head, leaping like a panther.
3357	3.22	a	There was Nepthys, on the other side of the pews, holding the wooden box in his hand.
3358	3.22	a	I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes.
3359	2.8	a	I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held the box in front of my face.
3360	2.62	a	The blade lodged in the wood, its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin.
3361	2.6	a	Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand.
3362	2.5	a	His first move pulled out the dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box, and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards.
3363	3.4	a	He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin.
3364	3.0	a	Behind him, I saw Nepthys running between the pews.
3365	2.3	a	I raised the stake; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine.
3366	2.11	a	The stake went down, there was a blur, and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw.
3367	2.4	a	Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant, then all went numb.
3368	2.8	a	Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open.
3369	2.71	a	My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said, “This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking.”
3370	2.6	a	“This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking.”
3371	1.9	a	Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack.
3372	2.3	a	I must have fallen to the floor then.
3373	2.38	a	I could perceive Nepthys’ sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone.
3374	2.9	a	The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness.
3375	2.75	a	I thought I heard Rachel’s voice blearily calling for me.
3376	2.7	a	I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek.
3377	3.2	a	I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected.
3378	3.0	a	Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake.
3379	3.0	a	I stood and turned toward the altar.
3380	2.56	a	The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me.
3381	2.3	a	Then the stake came down into his back and one, two, three strikes with the hammer drove it in.
3382	2.38	a	The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth.
3383	3.0	a	Behind me, Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys, whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug.
3384	3.0	a	I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar.
3385	2.33	a	Rachel, her clothes torn and her face drawn, looked like she might cry when she saw me.
3386	3.7	a	I pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me.
3387	3.5	a	“My fuckin’ hero,”
3388	3.8	a	“My fuckin’ hero,” she whispered.
3389	2.9	a	He didn’t move, just stared and held his drink.
3390	3.0	a	The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving.
3391	3.1	a	She nodded and he took her arm.
3392	2.4	a	I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong.
3393	2.5	a	Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn’t come home.
3394	2.4	a	I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses, but I had no luck.
3395	3.0	a	A couple of them remembered seeing her leave, but none of them had seen the thin man with her.
3396	2.78	a	I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features, even in that distorting light.
3397	3.0	a	Nathan’s Bylichka
3398	3.0	a	I caught a taxi back to the church.
3399	2.9	a	I walked across what had been the dance floor.
3400	3.1	a	The church was completely different now: sunlight fell through the stained glass, catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry, healthy warmth into the edges of the room, through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights.
3401	2.8	a	Standing in the center of the church, I took out my cell phone and called the police.
3402	2.3	a	“I need to file a missing persons report.
3403	2.82	a	…Rachel Frieze.
3404	2.9	a	What?
3405	2.7	a	…But, sir, this is an unusual situation.
3406	3.1	a	"But if you ever should see a faerie, tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly."""
3407	3.1	a	…Yes, sir.
3408	3.0	a	I understand.”
3409	2.7	a	The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight.
3410	2.9	a	Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise.
3411	2.82	a	A cold front must have hit while I was inside.
3412	2.5	a	Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran.
3413	2.63	a	After I’d walked about a block, a car rolled up behind me.
3414	2.2	a	It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry.
3415	2.6	a	This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods.
3416	2.9	a	I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it.
3417	3.0	a	I turned around.
3418	2.5	a	The man looked over forty, and he was driving a car I’d be afraid to drive on this street.
3419	2.91	a	“It’s a long way to anywhere worth going,”
3420	3.0	a	he said.
3421	3.38	a	“Ah, I think I’m fine, thanks,” I told him, and turned back to the sidewalk.
3422	3.0	a	"As I got older, I shook the tales off with a nod and a ""Yes, Nana."""
3423	3.4	a	“Really, I’d like to help.
3424	2.7	a	You don’t look dressed for this weather.”
3425	2.8	a	I glanced back over my shoulder.
3426	3.4	a	I’m just fine.
3427	2.8	a	Really, don’t worry about me.”
3428	3.0	a	I stopped and looked back at him, surprised.
3429	2.8	a	“How do you know my name?”
3430	3.0	a	“I know your family.
3431	2.9	a	Get in.
3432	2.9	a	We have a lot of work ahead of us, and it’s best to start now.”
3433	3.1	a	"""Yes, Nana."""
3434	3.0	a	I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat.
3435	2.8	a	Before I had my belt on, we were rolling forward.
3436	3.09	a	“Okay,”
3437	2.9	a	“Okay,” I said.
3438	3.0	a	“I’m in the car.
3439	2.75	a	Now, will you tell me how you know my family, and how you happened to be driving by just now?
3440	2.7	a	In fact, why didn’t you call me by name the first time?
3441	3.1	a	And how did you recognize me when – ”
3442	2.9	a	I can only answer one question at a time.
3443	3.2	a	I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours.
3444	2.9	a	I am here now because you called for help, and no-one else would answer.”
3445	3.0	a	He turned onto the next street and shifted up.
3446	2.9	a	Also, international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap labor.
3447	2.7	a	Jobs were scarce in other steel-exporting countries, and labor laws were either non-existent or allowed employers to pay much less for work.
3448	2.89	a	Labor costs in America continued to go up, draining US companies of their resources, while companies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities.
3449	3.0	a	On a worldwide scale, newer materials such as aluminum, plastic, and composites were beginning to substitute steel both at home and abroad.
3450	2.7	a	Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline, and it affected both domestic and foreign companies.
3451	2.8	a	America’s steel remained unsold, flooding the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy.
3452	2.2	a	Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry, but it was not alone.
3453	2.4	a	The problem was a national one, involving many more mills and issues than Youngstown’s alone.
3454	2.9	a	J. Philip Richley, a union member and organizer of many attempts to save 5the mills, has summed it up thus: “You just can’t solve a nation-wide problem in a single city.”
3455	2.71	a	Trying to prop up one city’s mills was impossible when faced with the depression that spread throughout the entire industry.
3456	2.5	a	The Save Our Valley Campaign: Lack of Funds and Plans
3457	3.11	a	As the name suggests, local leaders wanted to instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency, driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region.
3458	2.8	a	The events that would follow this date (known as Black Monday) are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope.
3459	3.2	a	Marches, speeches, and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the Campaign and rally the people.
3460	2.22	a	The people of Youngstown, being now unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive.
3461	2.9	a	College tuition, clothes, food, and heating all had to come before donations to non-profit organizations.
3462	2.8	a	People outside of the area had no personal investment in the mills, and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds.
3463	2.78	a	The lack of money proved to be crippling, because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively.
3464	2.4	a	Without funds, the Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the city’s dying economy.
3465	2.56	a	Letters and petitions were all very well, but they did little to improve the situation.
3466	3.0	a	People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization, but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work; the people of Youngstown were, after all, not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general.
3467	2.27	a	Beyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped forward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down.
3468	2.6	a	Without funds to drive the efforts, or even a real plan of action, the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than good.
3469	2.7	a	In effect, it raised the hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything.
3470	2.89	a	People became excited and waited for the mills to reappear, but they never did.
3471	2.44	a	The Campaign failed to save any jobs and Youngstown was plunged into economic chaos.
3472	2.75	a	The Apathy of USWA
3473	3.0	a	United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit.
3474	3.0	a	Initially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs.
3475	3.1	a	However, it soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight, the international branch was not.
3476	2.4	a	The higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight, attempting to shut out the appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening.
3477	2.8	a	Actually, one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do.
3478	2.9	a	No one had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before, and none of the leaders of USWA, not even president Lynn Williams, knew what could be done.
3479	2.5	a	It was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings would be one of the worst in US history, and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered.
3480	2.5	a	Rather than try and come up with some sort of scenario, the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown, hoping that perhaps the problem would resolve itself, or at least not spread any further than it already had.
3481	2.5	a	Besides incompetence, the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart: fear of socialism.
3482	2.8	a	Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action, but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism.
3483	2.75	a	If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the government (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism.
3484	2.5	a	This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people, something they could not afford to do.
3485	2.8	a	Therefore, they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch fight it out alone.
3486	3.0	a	Regionalism
3487	3.0	a	Youngstown is the name of the major city area, but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself.
3488	2.44	a	Petitions, protests, rallies, collectivization, and even the takeover of a steel company’s headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the only source of employment that this town had.
3489	2.8	a	Boardman, Poland Township, Struthers, Lowellville, Warren, Lordstown, Canfield, Niles, and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown (see Figure 3).
3490	3.0	a	People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town.
3491	3.1	a	However, although traffic is heavy between each separate district, each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity, educational system, heritage, history, and even food.
3492	3.0	a	For example, Struthers is a poor town with a large Slovak population, where education is generally better than in surrounding towns, but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread.
3493	3.0	a	Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist.
3494	3.0	a	Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman Catholic, with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side.
3495	3.7	a	Unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding towns, and the streets are clean and well kept.
3496	3.0	a	With many more cultures, religions, and economic levels living in close proximity to one another, a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area: regionalism.
3497	3.1	a	Each town, with their own identity, instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations, which dictates many habits, exchanges, and interactions between populations.
3498	2.2	a	Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred, with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others.
3499	2.62	a	With so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause, even one that would save their jobs and their futures.
3500	2.78	a	Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from Campbell, and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman, even if they were supposed to be working towards the same thing.
3501	2.75	a	A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement, because no one was willing to put aside regional differences to work together.
3502	2.88	a	In some instances, small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area, but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate.
3503	2.13	a	These well-intentioned efforts ultimately failed, leaving thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind.
3504	2.9	a	Conclusion: The Aftershock and the Significance of Black Monday
3505	2.0	a	Black Monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people.
3506	2.7	a	The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact were unsuccessful for four main reasons: the failure of the international steel market, the lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear, and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies.
3507	2.9	a	What happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level, and perhaps it is not.
3508	2.6	a	But to the thousands of people living there, the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic, political, and social futures.
3509	2.3	a	Because of the mills and their conspicuous absence, hundreds of people were uprooted, forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities.
3510	2.63	a	Hundreds more joined the unemployment lines, or even began living on the streets.
3511	3.0	a	For the people of Youngstown, Black Monday was not just a historical event- it was the most important event in their lives.
3512	3.1	a	Even though they eventually failed, the fact that they tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives and the futures of their children.
3513	2.75	a	But why did the brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail?
3514	3.0	a	An Extended Essay in History
3515	2.63	a	When examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry.
3516	2.5	a	Most importantly, the problem in Youngstown was a nationwide problem.
3517	2.5	a	Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level.
3518	3.12	a	A Brief History of Steel in Northeastern Ohio
3519	3.1	a	In 1802 James and Daniel Heaton discovered ore and coal lining Yellow Creek in an area outside of Youngstown known as Poland Township.
3520	2.89	a	Their blast furnace, “Hopewell,” was the very first blast furnace in the area.
3521	3.11	a	During the Civil War, Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products.
3522	2.89	a	Youngstown also was a major railway crossroads, due to its strategic position between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago.
3523	3.1	a	In fact, “More rail cars passed under the Center Street Bridge [a major bridge in Youngstown] per day than any other location in the country.”
3524	3.0	a	During the 19th century, the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast (Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania) to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast, including the Mahoning Valley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky.
3525	3.11	a	By 1880, Youngstown’s population had grown to nearly 16,000, which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty-year period.
3526	3.4	a	The town continued to prosper, driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills.
3527	2.62	a	This prosperity continued until the late 1920s, when the Great Depression hit the area hard.
3528	2.7	a	Despite the Congress of Industrial Organization’s successful efforts to establish a national steel workers’ union, the industry barely survived the Depression years.
3529	3.3	a	Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth.
3530	3.1	a	In 1973, the Experimental Negotiating Agreement was signed.
3531	2.44	a	This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down.
3532	3.1	a	At the same time, stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel parts, and the overeager shareholders in the companies’ stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie.
3533	2.6	a	Most importantly, Youngstown’s steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive.
3534	3.0	a	September 19, 1977 is a date that few people in Youngstown, Ohio will ever forget.
3535	2.8	a	Old technology was not replaced, obsolete methods were not updated, and almost none of the industry’s profits were being utilized to help modernize.
3536	3.0	a	Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement.
3537	2.2	a	On that date Jennings Lambeth, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, announced that most of the steel company’s Campbell Works would close.
3538	2.75	a	“If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”
3539	2.75	a	The closings meant the end of Youngstown’s only real industry, the end of its population growth, and then end of economic progress.
3540	2.8	a	Without the mills, people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country.
3541	2.67	a	Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets.
3542	2.33	a	Without an industrial or a residential base, commerce shrank considerably.
3543	2.4	a	It was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills, the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town, inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape.
3544	3.0	a	Attempts to Save the Mills
3545	2.9	a	The very first thing that the workers could do was “to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,” says Ed Mann, a local union leader and organizer.
3546	3.1	a	“to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,”
3547	3.2	a	The petition was circulated, eventually including thousands of signatures; it was then given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington.
3548	2.86	a	However, the representatives were shunted to the side and ignored in Washington, since Youngstown’s political influence had died with its industry.
3549	2.86	a	The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power, but they refused to support the local union members.
3550	2.5	a	The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure.
3551	3.14	a	Next, workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition, an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works.
3552	2.43	a	Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback, for the people of Youngstown and the surrounding area, it meant disaster.
3553	2.75	a	Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government.
3554	2.2	a	Here, too, they were ignored.
3555	2.7	a	The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills, so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed.
3556	2.9	a	Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown.
3557	3.1	a	They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the Headquarters and took it over.
3558	2.63	a	Immediately after the workers left the building, US steel representatives told the local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the mill.
3559	2.25	a	All these efforts eventually came to nothing, and Youngstown’s steel mills remained closed.
3560	2.75	a	These attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American steel impossible to sell or export.
3561	2.1	a	The Decline of the World Market
3562	2.6	a	The efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up.
3563	2.86	a	In fact, American steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports.
3564	3.1	a	Foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make, and was often of higher quality than domestic steel.
3565	3.1	a	Foreign steel companies invested in their factories, updating their technology and replacing their equipment often.
3566	3.0	a	Foreign steel was also much cheaper.
3567	2.56	a	Wage hikes, although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in the US, made American steel far more expensive.
3568	3.0	a	You can mix them with a 30/30/40 mix of potting soil, worm casings and clay.
3569	3.1	a	Or you could go out to the shed and grab a few handfuls of that sod mix you got at that estate sale last year and get to mixing.
3570	3.0	a	NOTE: Cover your work area.
3571	2.7	a	Dust can fly into your mouth and eyes very easily.
3572	2.5	a	If the fertilizer in the mix is what I think it is, that wouldn't be pretty.
3573	3.1	a	Use gloves to break up the soil with your fingers.
3574	3.0	a	Form the mix into balls of any size from sling-shot-pellet up to softball.
3575	3.0	a	You're going to be throwing them.
3576	3.1	a	Customize it yourself.
3577	3.0	a	Mine were more or less matzoh-ball size and shape, out of habit.
3578	3.67	a	This worked out pretty well.
3579	3.1	a	Allow to dry overnight, or until they're solid enough for the next step.
3580	3.0	a	4. Throw.
3581	3.3	a	Today, I kept it simple.
3582	3.08	a	I chose one abandoned property a few minutes from downtown, and two vacant lots.
3583	2.9	a	The leftovers went onto the jungles alongside the freeway offramps.
3584	2.89	a	First lesson learned -- you need at least two people to seedbomb from a vehicle .
3585	2.3	a	I found this hard to do while also avoiding cops, dealing with the camera and the car window, scoping out angles of approach for throwing, etc.
3586	3.0	a	Seedbombing combines elements of childhood disgruntled mudbomb-hurling; the balance of meticulousness and zen that good gardeners possess; and my own forte, the invisibility and vigilance of a sniper.
3587	2.11	a	I ended up with a broken fingernail and dirt all over my lap.
3588	3.6	a	Also, a perfect strike.
3589	3.0	a	But you'll have to take my word because a camera at that moment would have been crazy.
3590	3.0	a	Second Lesson -- keep the seedbombs in a shallow covered container .
3591	3.0	a	You want both tidiness and easy access.
3592	2.8	a	Plus, those things are crumbly.
3593	4.0	a	And the last lesson -- have fun .
3594	3.09	a	It's play.
3595	2.8	a	It's chlorophyll graffiti.
3596	3.0	a	No one I know is getting digg'd or favrd yet for throwing color and scent around the ghetto.
3597	2.89	a	Do it to see how it feels.
3598	3.1	a	You may want to keep checking on your flowers (I promise I will) or you might get an idea to do something else completely unexpected (I did).
3599	2.9	a	Enzo Angolini spike heels found by serendipity at St Paul's Thrift for $3.98.
3600	3.3	a	Sexy, non?
3601	3.1	a	For example, make smaller wildflower seedbombs and carefully 'plant' them in a meridian by making holes in the ground with your heel and then gently tamping the dirt over them with your sole.
3602	3.0	a	'plant'
3603	3.0	a	This is also good practice for looking lost and cluelessly invisible.
3604	3.0	a	More on that in future posts.
3605	3.0	a	Earth is my friend, like that old classmate who you keep forgetting to drop a note to on Facebook.
3606	3.9	a	When I took a victory lap and hand-wash break in the mall, I was happy, not in a smug superior way, but in the knowledge that I had avenged myself against the whole Sunday-at-the-mall culture that I felt smothered by.
3607	2.3	a	There is one over-riding message to this -- Quit being such a goddamned perfectionist.
3608	3.0	a	Yes, yes, I know, you know of much better places to never throw those seedbombs you haven't made.
3609	3.25	a	You could get better soil if you put it on the shopping list.
3610	3.0	a	The actions that you never do are absolutely perfectly effective, in your imagination.
3611	2.9	a	Which brings us back to: 1.
3612	2.8	a	A job worth doing is worth doing crappily.
3613	3.0	a	This blog is the digital proof.
3614	3.0	a	"6 Responses to ""The Apocalyptic Housewife Goes Seedbombing"""
3615	3.0	a	The first step to seedbombing is:
3616	3.0	a	Kate 25. Nov, 2009 at 3:37 pm
3617	2.9	a	Did this with my aunt in Griffith Park after the last bout of fires.
3618	3.0	a	Didn't know there was a term for it- my mom and aunt have been seed bombing for years.
3619	3.3	a	They'll be glad to know it is catching on among the under-60 set.
3620	3.1	a	Raggedy Anarchy 25. Nov, 2009 at 5:46 pm
3621	3.6	a	Thanks for commenting, Kate.
3622	4.0	a	Your mom and aunt sound great.
3623	2.7	a	1. Understand that a job worth doing is worth doing crappily.
3624	2.75	a	I used to see this old scary dude walking around checking the trees in Griffith Park for Dutch Elm Disease.
3625	2.9	a	Turns out he had been a brilliant biology student before losing derferment and going to Vietnam.
3626	3.5	a	Thanks for making me remember him.
3627	3.3	a	We are everywhere.
3628	3.0	a	Summer 26. Nov, 2009 at 10:52 am
3629	4.2	a	Loved this!
3630	3.0	a	brian 14. Dec, 2009 at 8:10 pm
3631	3.86	a	Awesome idea though.
3632	3.4	a	My wife and I did this when we lived in Texas ... planted blue bonnets in a state park.
3633	3.0	a	"Yeah, I know, ""Texas has plenty of blue bonnets,"" you say ..."
3634	3.0	a	"""Texas has plenty of blue bonnets,"""
3635	3.0	a	Well we thought they could use more.
3636	2.89	a	Jessica Reeder 15. Dec, 2009 at 9:08 am
3637	2.27	a	You will fuck it up .
3638	4.0	a	That was nice of you.
3639	3.44	a	There is no such thing as too many flowers.
3640	3.9	a	Well done.
3641	3.0	a	We just made seedbombs for our holiday gift baskets; they're a mix of flowers from the yard, heavy on the poppies.
3642	2.8	a	Live with this.
3643	2.5	a	I am not nice, young, hip, white, rich, educated, suburban or any of the other things you are unconsciously assuming anyone who loves the earth must be.
3644	3.2	a	Embrace it.
3645	3.0	a	My discontent is the mother of invention, and by invention, I mean creative re-purposing.
3646	3.0	a	Nothing worth doing was learned perfectly the first time.
3647	3.38	a	I love bringing apt quotations and poems to awkward occasions the way another guest would bring a box of See's.
3648	3.2	a	Actually, I do that, too.
3649	3.0	a	Anyone who doesn't have a sweet tooth is bound to have a mean streak, and freegan chocolates are perfectly salvagable most of the time.
3650	3.11	a	That's me.
3651	3.0	a	I'm the Apocalyptic Housewife.
3652	3.6	a	I take pictures and have ideas and enjoy my thoughts and try to do a little something less about consuming and more about redemption every day.
3653	3.0	a	Here's where we started -
3654	3.0	a	This is the first in a series of articles by guest blogger The Apocalyptic Housewife .
3655	3.6	a	Thanks, MamaHun.
3656	3.0	a	2. Mix in seeds.
3657	3.0	a	Use seeds of any kind, even dumpster-salvaged ones, or the ones that might be too old for the garden.

4601	3.3	a	"""People will read such stories; they are worth publishing."""
4602	3.0	a	Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close.
4603	2.6	a	"""That is precisely why I must excise this malignant instinct!"""
4604	3.0	a	"""Why do you write?"""
4605	3.0	a	"""…Why – to earn a living, I suppose."
4606	3.0	a	"Why do you ask?"""
4607	2.83	a	"""You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter, though you face such difficulty."
4608	2.2	a	"I would not be happy, thus separated from it."""
4609	3.09	a	"""So at its heart, then, your writing – as opposed to working otherwise – is for yourself?"""
4610	3.0	a	"""Yes, I suppose one could see it thus."
4611	2.43	a	"But really, Nathan, your queer habits of conversation have reached a new level."""
4612	2.9	a	"""Your writing is for you, Allan, not for the publishers or some imagined audience."
4613	3.0	a	Since you seem unable to write 'normally,' why not embrace your tales as they are, leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is a source of pleasure?
4614	3.2	a	Your stories strike a chord with the deepest, most ancient stories of mankind, the tales basic to humanity.
4615	3.12	a	Tell them, and they will create an audience.
4616	2.7	a	Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank.
4617	3.0	a	He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers.
4618	3.0	a	His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon.
4619	3.0	a	He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward.
4620	3.0	a	Arthur looked up from the results of a night’s frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye.
4621	2.89	a	"""What is this?"""
4622	3.1	a	he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand.
4623	2.7	a	"""I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,"" Allan replied, somewhat less self-assured than he had been the previous night."
4624	3.2	a	Although the concept was a simple one, Allan thought it had potential.
4625	2.3	a	"""What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,"" cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice."
4626	2.8	a	He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son.
4627	2.22	a	"""This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!"""
4628	2.36	a	He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat.
4629	2.8	a	"""Do you hate the modern system of literature?"
4630	2.75	a	Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare?
4631	2.9	a	"Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare??"""
4632	3.0	a	"?"""
4633	3.0	a	For a moment, Allan could hardly do more than shake his head.
4634	2.8	a	"""No, of course not… I– """
4635	2.55	a	"""Then why,"""
4636	2.27	a	"""Then why,"" Arthur barreled on, ""do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel?"
4637	2.44	a	"""do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel?"
4638	2.4	a	"Why do you disregard my warnings, my careful advice given in the best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption, this literary debauchery?"""
4639	3.3	a	Perhaps this will be more saleable, he thought and began to write.
4640	2.38	a	He glared at Allan, eyes impaling him and demanding a response.
4641	3.0	a	"""Could you write decent tales with that willow at your window?"""
4642	2.46	a	Allan cried out at last, stepping forward and casting his arms open, confronting Arthur with this demanding, pleading interrogation.
4643	2.78	a	"""Its twigs rap constantly against the wall, the wind always demanding my attention."
4644	3.0	a	"How could any writer accommodate the edicts of popular literature with the very forces of nature knocking upon his door?"""
4645	2.8	a	Arthur looked down his nose at the distraught author, viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was Arthur Mason.
4646	2.7	a	A tree forced you to write this, my dear Mr. Clemm?
4647	2.8	a	"I must admit, this seems far-fetched, even by your standards – even your Nathan might have difficulty believing you."""
4648	2.75	a	"""You don't know what this is like,"""
4649	2.2	a	"""You don't know what this is like,"" said Allan, shaking his head."
4650	3.25	a	"""Nathan would understand completely."""
4651	2.8	a	Even as he said it, Allan prayed that his statement was true.
4652	3.0	a	"""Very well,"""
4653	2.9	a	"""Very well,"" said Arthur; ""then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you."
4654	2.5	a	"""then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you."
4655	2.3	a	"If you insist on abandoning me, I shall not hold you."""
4656	2.3	a	With that, he tossed the papers at Allan and left the room.
4657	2.9	a	He then turned and left through the door opposite that Arthur had taken, making his way past his host's doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathan's residence, several miles away.
4658	3.0	a	Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself, a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period.
4659	2.63	a	Allan leaned forward unconsciously.
4660	3.0	a	"""What about Roger?"""
4661	3.3	a	Allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair, his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts.
4662	2.8	a	"""So,"" he asked, ""you don't think it's a waste of ink and paper, a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?"""
4663	2.8	a	she asked, knowing that the answer no longer mattered.
4664	2.4	a	"""you don't think it's a waste of ink and paper, a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?"""
4665	2.11	a	"""Heavens, no,"""
4666	2.1	a	"""Heavens, no,"" said Nathan, aghast."
4667	3.8	a	"""This is one of the strongest works I've read in ages."
4668	3.1	a	It speaks to the deepest storyteller's instinct within us all, yet is entirely original.
4669	3.22	a	Oh, they may rail against you at first; they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage; but while those in power say such things, others will read your tales and see their true worth.
4670	3.1	a	"Believe me when I say that you will be read a century from now."""
4671	3.09	a	Allan, though dubious as to that possibility, felt some temptation from the compliment; mainly, it granted him the encouragement he still needed.
4672	3.36	a	Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him, then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face.
4673	3.2	a	This is good, he thought, pausing to raise the low light of the lantern.
4674	3.0	a	Certainly, it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them.
4675	3.5	a	His mind's strangest fruit had ripened at last, and he found the taste less bitter than expected.
4676	3.4	a	Passionate, fiery colors filled the western sky before him, though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead.
4677	3.7	a	I'm almost done, and the happy ending is just falling into place.
4678	3.0	a	Allan's thoughts fled as one, scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume.
4679	3.0	a	He ran the last distance, crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below, walking to the carriage parked before Allan's house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicle's roof.
4680	2.62	a	Arthur paused in the door, looking up at Allan for a moment; then he turned and shut the door behind him.
4681	3.5	a	I hardly dare to think it, but – I may finish this story!
4682	2.89	a	The driver snapped the reins and set the horses on.
4683	3.0	a	As they trotted forth, Allan's eyes remained trapped by the carriage, following it up the hillock and past himself.
4684	3.0	a	The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows.
4685	2.57	a	When they had gone, he remained, stunned, until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself.
4686	2.7	a	He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done.
4687	3.0	a	Rounding the corner, he saw a great bonfire.
4688	2.6	a	As he thought this, a sinuous wind encircled the house, slipping through the walls to chill him.
4689	2.9	a	It was a moment before he realized what else had changed: near the wall, beneath his window, was a stump with black and ancient bark.
4690	2.4	a	In a thoughtless panic, Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre.
4691	3.25	a	His thoughts were not of the act's futility, nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing; instead, all that filled his mind was the tree's constant presence in his life, growing with him and beside him, its persistent reminders that he had higher, truer things to write, the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake.
4692	2.2	a	His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers.
4693	2.82	a	But he did not weep.
4694	3.0	a	Instead, he bethought himself of the loss of the tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not come of this, after all.
4695	2.78	a	The papers and the lantern's flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on Allan's window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door.
4696	2.6	a	Leaving the circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards the woods, in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood.
4697	2.88	a	Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time, thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog, strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate.
4698	3.3	a	He considered Arthur's intervention; considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested, to write stories that others would read; for after all, what purpose writing if not to be read?
4699	3.0	a	Indeed, if he still could not, he could at any time follow Arthur's advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality.
4700	3.11	a	Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind.
4701	3.14	a	As it turned to the deeper woods, elder giants rose above him: a beech, smooth bark a gray-green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark, cracked trunks of the nearer trees; great pines, a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three-stroke symbol of the British King; a towering black birch, leaves impossibly high above him.
4702	3.0	a	As the stream wound its way through the largest pines, grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings, Allan continued, slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants.
4703	2.9	a	This was no stranger, however; the twisted, ancient thing was older than Allan, its branches rapping on his window since his childhood.
4704	2.75	a	There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass.
4705	2.9	a	Emerging from between the antediluvian trunks, Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped.
4706	3.2	a	Before him, roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream, grew a stand of black willows.
4707	2.5	a	Though the elders' trunks fell and died, their children, first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead, continued unabated, a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors.
4708	2.6	a	Allan stumbled forward, jaw slightly slack, until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted, three-trunked willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself.
4709	3.0	a	After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner.
4710	2.0	a	Collapsing at its base, Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan, a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks, falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream, flowing through the ground beneath them.
4711	2.8	a	Its thin, drawn fingers framed the bloated moon, whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly.
4712	2.5	a	The great, jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author, who gazed up through his window's tiny frame with trepidation.
4713	2.8	a	Allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him.
4714	3.3	a	His pen flickered forth, words dancing out from its nib.
4715	3.25	a	For while the lantern's spark shivered in the chill breeze, this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owner's pen, scratching out the rhythm of the willow's fingers.
4716	3.38	a	The frenzied writing ceased at last, the author leaned back with a slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort.
4717	2.5	a	He held a hand to his forehead, eyes closed and face flushed.
4718	2.11	a	After all that – so near the end, to lose control again.
4719	3.0	a	His breath returning to its normal rhythms, he dared to look at the page before him.
4720	3.2	a	His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears, he draped his loose cape over her shoulders.
4721	3.22	a	"""Where I am to take you, one need never think of those left behind."""
4722	3.0	a	His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow.
4723	3.0	a	They took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting.
4724	2.4	a	She gaped, afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand.
4725	2.46	a	The New England woods disappeared, even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky.
4726	3.4	a	Above them, the Milky Way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached.
4727	2.5	a	Allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window.
4728	1.75	a	"""Damn you,"""
4729	1.78	a	"""Damn you,"" he cried, ""will you never leave me be?"
4730	2.18	a	"""will you never leave me be?"
4731	2.5	a	"Shall I never finish a story in peace?"""
4732	1.9	a	He pounded his desk in vain, cursing the foul muse that drove him.
4733	3.0	a	The next day, Allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a well-furnished parlor.
4734	3.0	a	Allan took a sandwich between his fingers.
4735	3.9	a	"""Thank you, Arthur."""
4736	3.0	a	The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards.
4737	3.0	a	In a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial, he refilled their glasses.
4738	3.38	a	"""How is the writing these days, my dear Mr. Clemm?"""
4739	2.5	a	"""Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr. Mason,"""
4740	2.4	a	"""Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr. Mason,"" Allan sighed."
4741	3.7	a	"""I had a perfect story in my pages; my hero returned home and reclaimed his love, I nearly had it tied together before…"""
4742	3.12	a	"""Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe – though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others, thank Heaven."""
4743	2.37	a	Arthur's face assumed a long-suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation.
4744	2.9	a	"""I'm not familiar with Mr. Poe's works, but I assume you're referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic."""
4745	2.8	a	"This is more like a compulsion, a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment, then leaps and takes ahold of me, screaming out through my quill."""
4746	2.2	a	"""How perfectly awful."""
4747	2.6	a	"""I'm sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption."""
4748	2.8	a	"""I know,"" Allan replied, ""but how am I to do that?"
4749	2.37	a	"You know I do not wish to make my stories thus; but it is my nemesis, confronting me anew at every turn!"""
4750	2.4	a	Arthur raised a critical brow.
4751	2.71	a	Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal; and believe me, Allan, you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish.
4752	2.43	a	"There simply is no audience for fairy tales – no literate audience, at least."""
4753	3.0	a	"""It is true,"""
4754	2.5	a	"""It is true,"" Allan admitted, fidgeting with his cufflinks, ""that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher."
4755	2.44	a	"""that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher."
4756	2.63	a	I've even tried rewriting the corrupted sections, but once my characters have gone down that road, nothing can recall their former life.
4757	2.91	a	"My prodigal ink-blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road."""
4758	2.83	a	"""If only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours, you might write something really worth reading."
4759	2.6	a	"It's hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print, like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd."""
4760	2.38	a	Allan hung his head, holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees.
4761	2.83	a	He scratched the back of his dark-haloed head and blinked bleary eyes.
4762	2.9	a	"""I would drive it out,"""
4763	2.4	a	"""I would drive it out,"" he said softly, ""but I fear for what would remain."""
4764	2.25	a	"""but I fear for what would remain."""
4765	3.12	a	"""You might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat, improve your disposition."""
4766	3.12	a	"""Perhaps it would,"""
4767	2.67	a	"""Perhaps it would,"" Allan replied, rising and vainly straightening his suit."
4768	3.0	a	"""I shall consider it; in the meantime, however, I must be off."
4769	4.0	a	"You have been a gracious host, as always."""
4770	3.22	a	Arthur rose and shook his hand.
4771	3.57	a	"""So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home,"""
4772	2.9	a	"""I hope soon to see you in better sorts."""
4773	3.0	a	They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur's gate.
4774	2.86	a	He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust.
4775	3.0	a	Some quarter-mile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by a halloo.
4776	2.5	a	he called out to the empty road.
4777	3.2	a	The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree.
4778	3.2	a	"""I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today,"""
4779	3.2	a	"""I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today,"" said Nathan, ""so I thought I'd wait here for you."""
4780	3.3	a	"""so I thought I'd wait here for you."""
4781	3.0	a	Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton.
4782	3.1	a	His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy.
4783	3.0	a	"""So, Allan,"""
4784	3.0	a	"""So, Allan,"" said Nathan, unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside, ""how goes life for the quintessential American author?"""
4785	3.0	a	"""how goes life for the quintessential American author?"""
4786	2.67	a	"""I wouldn't know,"""
4787	2.73	a	"""I wouldn't know,"" replied Allan dryly, before continuing in another tone entirely."
4788	2.3	a	"""I destroyed another story last night, Nathan."""
4789	2.9	a	Leaning against his tree, Nathan shook his head.
4790	3.8	a	"""Yes, it is finished!"
4791	3.5	a	Ended!
4792	2.8	a	Never again shall it see the rosy-fingered dawn!
4793	2.57	a	Nathan, you've read these abominations of mine.
4794	2.7	a	Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best.
4795	2.67	a	"At best, they are faery tales; at worst, expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see."""
4796	2.88	a	"""So instead, you would write – what?"""
4797	2.38	a	On a sunny Sunday afternoon, the waiting list was an hour long.
4798	3.0	a	After hemming and hawing and assessing my food stash (contents: 10 saltines), I decided to go for it anyway.
4799	2.67	a	By the time I got to Asheville, I was nearing the end of my journey and the bottom of my wallet.
4800	3.2	a	"""grilled marinated free-range chicken breast on sourdough with melted havarti, romaine lettuce and cranberry mayonnaise"""
4801	3.0	a	Free range?
4802	3.0	a	Havarti?
4803	3.6	a	Yes, I could dig it.
4804	3.3	a	While I waited for the food, I checked out the back of the store where Tupelo Honey Cafe hawks their homestyle wares: preserves, pickles, salsa, honey, t-shirts, aprons and all sorts of mini-advertisements for the restaurant.
4805	3.6	a	I've visited plenty of farm-to-fork restaurants, and this one may be the best I've seen at self-marketing.
4806	3.0	a	There's nothing wrong with it: the food in those jars is probably delicious, though I question whether the $10 tupelo honey had to come from Florida or if it's produced locally.
4807	3.62	a	Either way, it's nice to see a restaurant built on ethics that also happens to be incredibly busy.
4808	3.0	a	Some of that is surely due to good marketing, but the real reason for its popularity is this:
4809	4.0	a	That sandwich was so good, I found myself eating slower and slower with each bite to savor it more completely.
4810	3.2	a	The potatoes were light and un-greasy; the flavors were perfectly balanced; the chicken was juicy and rich; and let's be honest here, I'm always happier eating dead animals when I know they've lived a good life.
4811	3.0	a	I will never forget you.
4812	2.71	a	I stopped eating halfway through, not because I was full.
4813	3.1	a	If you're going to a busy restaurant and want great service, bring a camera.
4814	2.9	a	No sooner had I taken the above photo, when a server (not even my server) appeared at my elbow.
4815	2.9	a	But.
4816	3.4	a	When I'd posted on Facebook that I was coming to town, no fewer than three people told me I just had to visit the Tupelo Honey Cafe .
4817	3.1	a	But wow, it sure improved once I appeared to be some sort of food critic or travel writer.
4818	3.1	a	Which, it just so happens, I am.
4819	3.2	a	But even if you're not, try this out sometime.
4820	3.14	a	I can't guarantee it'll work, but I personally will do it againand probably back it up with a stellar review, just like the one I've given the Tupelo Honey Cafe.
4821	4.0	a	Everybody wins.
4822	3.2	a	Next stop: sunny Tennessee, where I get down on The Farm.
4823	3.73	a	So I checked their website, and instantly fell in love:

4830	2.8	a	I was convinced but I wasn't alone.
4831	3.0	a	It started in 2001, when Andrew would ride around town pulling bikes out of dumpsters.
4832	3.25	a	He started hosting work parties with friends in his backyard, teaching them to fix their bikes and helping them get started riding.
4833	3.0	a	Slowly but surely, the circle grew and Andrew's backyard parties became weekly workshops.
4834	3.1	a	When Andrew decided to leave town for a few years' schooling in NYC, friends and cohorts took over operations.
4835	3.0	a	Come back Friday to read about anarchy, bike jousting, and two-wheeled social protest .
4836	3.2	a	These days it's an established club, run by volunteers and donations, turning trashed bikes into treasures.
4837	3.1	a	Its influence now includes a legitimate downtown storefront; a sister shop in Albany ( Albany Bicycle Coalition ); movie screenings and pro-cycling political events; and a dedicated core crew that keeps everything rolling.
4838	2.9	a	TBR's customers run the gamut, from businessmen to street kids to college students to families.
4839	3.0	a	The one thing they have in common?
4840	3.1	a	This group understands the value of a bicycle: more than just transportation, a bike is a statement against fossil fuels.
4841	3.25	a	More than a toy, it's an equalizer that allows poor kids to ride with rich.
4842	3.2	a	More than a hobby, it's a way of traveling through the world that lets you interact, use your muscles, breathe fresh air -- all for the cost of a free dumpster bike.
4843	3.3	a	Remember when you got your first bike?
4844	3.0	a	When I visited the TBR shop, it was packed with frames, wheels, gears, chains, handlebars, kids, and anarchist art (the space is being donated by some supporters who are also anti-capitalist activists).
4845	3.14	a	TBR hosts workshops twice a week.
4846	2.9	a	Was it a Christmas present, or maybe a birthday gift?
4847	3.11	a	Parts can be had for a pittance, and you can pick out your own bike from the stacks and racks of machines filling the space.
4848	3.0	a	The main focus of TBR, however, is not selling bikes.
4849	3.3	a	The idea is to give people a workspace and teach them how to maintain their own bicycle.
4850	3.0	a	An older man asked for tips on tuning his racer.
4851	3.0	a	A young kid came in to say his last bike was stolen and he needed a new one (and, despite Andrew's stern reprimand that he couldn't just walk in every week and leave with a free bike, he did just that).
4852	4.2	a	"""I love what you do,"""
4853	4.0	a	"""I love what you do,"" she said."
4854	3.4	a	"""I have a whole bunch of bikes to give you."""
4855	3.33	a	See, ultimately TBR is about more than just bicycles.
4856	3.0	a	It's about building community, and triggering a quiet but inexorable social movement.
4857	3.1	a	This is not the world's first bike collective; in fact it's only one of many that have stealthily sprung up around America.
4858	3.2	a	These collectives are not waiting for change to happen: they're creating it through small, positive, peaceful actions.
4859	2.9	a	Well, these days, most kids want an Xbox for their birthday; their parents ride around in cars with seatbelts, talking on their phones .
4860	3.3	a	You too can change the world: all you have to do is ride a bike.
4861	3.3	a	Fall is here, which (in most places) means great riding weather.
4862	3.0	a	It doesn't have to be perfect, just good enough to get you places.
4863	3.3	a	So pick one up, and ride it to the end of your block!
4864	3.17	a	Then keep going!
4865	3.0	a	Ride it to the corner store when you need milk, instead of driving across town to the grocery store.
4866	2.56	a	(Don't like the milk they sell?
4867	3.11	a	Tell the store owner what you like, and see if he'll carry it.
4868	3.75	a	Now you're changing the world.)
4869	3.5	a	On weekends, instead of driving to the park, hop on your bike and go exploring.
4870	3.2	a	It doesn't have to be a workout: you can just toodle around town and look at stuff.
4871	3.1	a	Or, if you're a gym buff, trade a workout for a bike ride.
4872	3.2	a	Save the World, Ride a Bike a visit to Troy Bike Rescue
4873	3.0	a	On vacation, rent a bike instead of a scooter (or, God forbid, a Segway).
4874	3.3	a	It's cheaper, and much better for the local flora&fauna.
4875	3.0	a	Still not convinced?
4876	3.3	a	Then think of it this way: by riding your bike instead of driving your car, you're reducing your consumption of fossil fuels.
4877	3.0	a	Cycling is a thing of the past: a sport, a hobby, but rarely a mode of transportation.
4878	3.1	a	Want to get involved?
4879	3.0	a	Can't find a bike community?
4880	2.9	a	Start your own!

4885	3.1	a	Bike rescue is not just for kids.
4886	2.4	a	One of my dear friends who can't drive to due to combat injuries had her ride stolen while we were sharing a beer in broad daylight last weekend.
4887	3.5	a	But I'm here to tell you: riding your bike is still fun, and still fast, and it's the cheapest and most socially responsible workout you'll ever get .
4888	2.1	a	Shame, shame.
4889	3.1	a	I passed along this article to her, and she suggest that when we start our own bike rescue, we'll do like the U.S. in East Timor did and graffiti Delta Bike Rescue on all the chassis.
4890	2.9	a	Fall is exactly 79% more tingly when experienced by bike.
4891	3.0	a	This post is the first of a three-part series on bike culture.
4892	3.0	a	In Troy, New York, I met one Andrew Lynn.
4893	3.14	a	He's somewhat of a man brain trust , and one of his best creations is the Troy Bike Rescue .
4894	3.37	a	David's a dedicated and inspired agrarian, whose passion for farming keeps him optimistic.
4895	2.9	a	But farming on the Outer Cape is the sort of Sisyphian challenge that can wear anybody out.
4896	2.5	a	Without fertilization, it deteriorates shockingly fast.
4897	3.0	a	David points out a patch of sand with a thin strip of fertile loam along the edge.
4898	3.12	a	Last season it was a fertile veggie bed -- but it was left un-fertilized as an experiment.
4899	2.4	a	"""This is what happens,"""
4900	2.75	a	"""This is what happens,"" David says."
4901	3.0	a	"""You have to keep feeding it organic material, or it turns back into sand."""
4902	3.37	a	Read about death & carnage in the shell shop , find out about the eco-friendly food scene , look at the pretty pretty sunset , or continue on...
4903	2.8	a	This plot was a test run, left untended for a single season.
4904	3.0	a	It's always been this way in North Truro.
4905	3.0	a	The Outer Cape is really just a spit of sand -- but still, farmers lived here for generations.
4906	3.0	a	How?
4907	3.25	a	There used to be a local tradition in this area: at each spring tide , the local community would head out to the bogs and marshes to harvest the grasses.
4908	3.0	a	"This was called ""salt marsh haying""."
4909	2.89	a	"""salt marsh haying"""
4910	3.1	a	Salt marsh hay has no weed seeds, and it doesn't compact as heavily as other types of hay.
4911	3.7	a	This makes it an excellent and bountiful source of compost, and it was used for generations as a soil enricher.
4912	2.62	a	"But haying had to happen regularly, says David: ""There's so much oxygen in this soil, any added compost gets burned up in six weeks."
4913	3.1	a	The only way to keep things going here is to keep a steady flow of compost coming in.
4914	2.8	a	That means truckloads of hay, and that means a lot of work.
4915	3.0	a	Last year, David and Arthur brought in a semi truck loaded with leaf mulch.
4916	2.89	a	It worked -- but it cost money, and it disappeared fast into the hungry ground.
4917	2.75	a	Not a long-term plan.
4918	2.62	a	Without that community support, it's nearly impossible for him to harvest hay often enough to keep the farm green.
4919	3.0	a	Meanwhile, in Tourist Town USA...
4920	3.0	a	The Provincetown farmers market has lovely produce, but little of it was grown on the Cape.
4921	3.14	a	Provincetown's official population of 3,500 supports a tourism industry that serves millions of visitors each year.
4922	3.8	a	City folk marvel at the quaint charms of the Cape, its idyllic beauty and simple pleasures.
4923	3.0	a	And then they go out to eat.
4924	3.1	a	With his long hair, scruffy beard and t-shirt, he'd fit in more at a Phish show than behind a plow.
4925	2.4	a	You can't squeeze blood from a stone, and you can't get big vegetable crops from sand dunes.
4926	2.88	a	End of story.
4927	2.9	a	Well, not exactly.
4928	2.9	a	David isn't giving up -- in fact, he's got plans and ideas to refashion North Truro's farming community.
4929	3.0	a	Hence the Ag Fair, and the ongoing experimentation with varieties and soils at First Light.
4930	3.12	a	David isn't alone: he's got the support (and companionship) of a growing group of gamechangers.
4931	3.22	a	If the young farmers and foodies of Truro can organize, they might just be able to get local agriculture back on its feet.
4932	3.14	a	Their main opponent?
4933	2.9	a	After all, what's the point of farming on the beach?

4949	3.57	a	However, the leather garment industry is growing, and there is a wide range of locally produced leather accessories, all at extremely attractive prices.
4950	2.8	a	For European imports, you will pay top dollar.
4951	3.0	a	Musical, Audio, and Video Equipment.

5097	3.5	a	Custom-made garments by skillful Hong Kong tailors are still much in demand and cost less than elsewhere for comparable garments.

5109	3.0	a	China (Porcelain).
5110	3.4	a	Factories in Kowloon and the New Territories, producing traditional and modern china, are geared to entertain and instruct visiting tourists; prices are appealing.
5111	3.4	a	In antiques shops, look for highly valued porcelains from China.

5132	3.1	a	The interesting Edwardian building was formerly the Pathological Institute, founded to combat the 19th century’s 30-year-long outbreak of bubonic plague.
5133	3.2	a	The old laboratory is still intact, and there are exhibits on Chinese pharmacology and the history of medicine in Hong Kong.
5134	2.67	a	Just to the east of the financial district, Wan Chai was once an area of sleazy clubs and topless bars; this was the setting for The World of Suzy Wong.
5135	3.3	a	Servicemen relaxing from the rigors of the Vietnam War poured millions of dollars into the Wan Chai boom of the 1960s.
5136	3.0	a	There are restaurants and a Starbuck’s in the basement, and you can access the raised pedestrian crosswalk from the escalators on the ground floor.
5137	3.0	a	There are still bars and clubs here, but the area has become almost mainstream, and office towers are replacing many of the sinful old premises.
5138	3.0	a	The Wan Chai waterfront is dominated by the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, the largest in Asia, which includes hotels, theaters, and exhibition halls.
5139	3.17	a	The convention center, an extension on reclaimed land, affords stunning views of the Wan Chai waterfront.
5140	3.1	a	Adjacent, just west of the convention center, is another modern highlight, the Academy for the Performing Arts on Gloucester Road.
5141	3.2	a	On Wan Chai’s Bowen Road, Maiden’s Rock, also called Lover’s Rock, is the gathering place for the annual Maiden’s festival.
5142	2.86	a	Although it is not a tourist attraction, the rock is steeped in tradition.
5143	3.2	a	Every August young women convene to light joss sticks and some even climb the nine-meter (30-ft) rock to pray for good husbands.
5144	3.0	a	About 2 km (a mile) east of Wan Chai, Causeway Bay is second only to Tsim Sha Tsui as Hong Kong’s place to shop.
5145	3.5	a	A prosperous tourist district, it is full of shopping centers and department stores, along with a number of good restaurants.
5146	3.5	a	The busy night-and-day crowds make this area vibrant and lively.
5147	3.12	a	On the nautical side is the Causeway Bay typhoon shelter, where expensive yachts are anchored almost gunwale to gunwale, and the Hong Kong Yacht Club has its headquarters.
5148	3.0	a	Next to the Jardine building is Exchange Square, a complex with a large shopping mall; just behind it is the General Post Office with a philatelic center on the ground floor.
5149	3.55	a	Silent for a time, the tradition has been revived and is a tourist attraction.
5150	3.0	a	It’s not clear how the custom started.
5151	3.0	a	One story has it that traders Jardine, Matheson & Co fired a private salute for a visiting tycoon, an act that incensed the colonial authorities, who felt that they had the sole right to issue such a 21-gun welcome.
5152	2.8	a	As a result, the merchants were forced to limit their salvoes to one a day — and from then on, they signaled the noon hour daily for all to hear.
5153	2.9	a	The gun was made famous by Noel Coward’s satirical song, “Mad Dogs and Englishmen. ”
5154	3.0	a	Farther east is Hong Kong’s largest park, Victoria Park, with sports grounds and other facilities.
5155	3.0	a	On the eastern side of Victoria Park on Causeway Road is Tin Hau Temple, dedicated to Tin Hau, the Taoist Queen of Heaven and patroness of seafarers.
5156	2.9	a	Originally the temple was on the shore but reclamation projects have now left it high and dry.
5157	3.22	a	Inland from the bay is Happy Valley.
5158	2.5	a	At one time it was a very miserable valley, a swampland conducive only to breeding malarial mosquitoes.
5159	3.2	a	It is home to Hong Kong’s first racetrack.
5160	3.33	a	Hong Kong’s gamblers are so eager to play the horses that, despite the opening of a bigger and better racetrack at Sha Tin, the Happy Valley Racecourse is thriving.
5161	3.1	a	Up Tai Hang Road behind Causeway Bay is Aw Boon Haw (Tiger Balm) Gardens (open daily 9:30am–4pm), founded in 1935 by the late Aw Boon Haw, who became a millionaire by producing the medicinal Tiger Balm.
5162	2.86	a	(It does not, in fact, contain any ingredients from tigers, but does promise to cure a wide range of problems such as colds, headaches, rheumatism, gout, toothache, and scorpion bites. )
5163	3.3	a	With its garish pagodas, artificial caves, and brightly painted statues of well-known Taoist and Buddhist legends, the garden is an obvious photo opportunity.
5164	3.1	a	Farther west is the ferry terminal for the outlying islands.
5165	2.82	a	Aberdeen, the island’s oldest settlement, once a pirate lair, is home to the “floating population” — the boat people who spend their entire lives on the junks in the harbor, some proudly claiming never to have set foot on land (except for funerals, which don’t count).
5166	3.5	a	The junks are a picturesque sight: children frolicking on the poop deck, women preparing food or playing mah-jong, elderly folk watching the sunset, dogs and cats underfoot, songbirds in bamboo cages overhead — and all afloat.
5167	3.11	a	The boats may appear deceptively primitive, but many of them have their own electric generators and all the modern conveniences.
5168	2.8	a	There are fewer boats now than in the past; many boat people, especially the younger generation, have moved to housing projects.
5169	3.1	a	You can take a tour of the port in one of the small sampans, propelled by hand by women drivers.
5170	3.0	a	A half-hour tour costs HK$50; pay at the end, or the driver may cut your trip short.
5171	3.12	a	Aberdeen’s theatrical floating restaurants have been a tourist attraction for many years.
5172	3.2	a	If you can get up early enough, you can attend the pre-dawn auction held at the vast local wholesale fish market; otherwise, have a look at the street market that goes on later in the day.
5173	3.0	a	The peninsula opposite the east coast of Ap Lei Chau island contains Ocean Park (open daily 10am–6pm; admission HK$150 adults, HK$75 children), which has become one of Hong Kong’s biggest attractions.
5174	3.0	a	It is divided into three areas: a highland, a lowland, and the Middle Kingdom.
5175	3.2	a	Linking the lowland and highland sections of the park, a cable-car system offers spectacular views across to the islands of the South China Sea.
5176	3.3	a	The Oceanarium is said to be the largest in the world, and the Ocean Theatre features displays by dolphins, killer whales, seals, and pelicans.
5177	3.7	a	An enormous roller-coaster rising way above the sea, space wheels, and high-diving shows guarantee a day of excitement.
5178	3.0	a	The Middle Kingdom is a recreated “living” history of China’s past, presented through a number of full-size replicas of shrines, temples, pagodas, palaces, and street scenes.
5179	3.3	a	There are also demonstrations of traditional Chinese crafts, including silk-weaving, pottery, and p apermaking.
5180	2.75	a	Water World, formerly in the complex, has closed for redevelopment.
5181	3.18	a	It’s so attractive and so easy to reach that it’s packed with sunbathers all summer long.
5182	2.8	a	Stanley was once one of the main fishing villages on Hong Kong Island.
5183	3.1	a	The well-known Stanley Mar­ket (see page 55) is a major source for bargain clothing and other merchandise.
5184	3.0	a	Stanley is also a favorite place of residence for ex-pats.
5185	3.3	a	The waterfronts at Repulse Bay and Stanley are lined with good cafés and restaurants.
5186	3.0	a	Though much smaller than Hong Kong Island, Kowloon has almost twice the population.
5187	3.0	a	In many areas, the density reaches the equivalent of 150,000 inhabitants per square km (a quarter square mile).
5188	3.1	a	Adjacent to the Star Ferry terminal is Ocean Terminal, where international cruise ships dock, and the gigantic Harbour City, a complex of malls, hotels, and restaurants.
5189	3.37	a	If you walk east on the Star Ferry terminal concourse, you will find yourself on the wonderful Promenade, which begins at the clock tower, all that remains of the once grand Kowloon-Canton Railway Terminus.
5190	3.4	a	The waterfront here offers unparalled views of the harbor and Hong Kong Island.
5191	2.88	a	If you continue to the end of the promenade, you will be in Tsim Sha Tsui East, a busy commercial district built on more than 60 hectares (150 acres) of reclaimed land.
5192	3.1	a	Flanked by the clock tower is the imposing Hong Kong Cultural Centre.
5193	2.9	a	Hong Kong’s major venue for the performing arts, the building has been criticized for its fortress-like architecture and windowless façade.
5194	2.9	a	Just east of the Star Ferry terminal, you’ll come to City Hall.
5195	3.43	a	The interior is a comfortable amalgam of Chinese and Western design, with an impressive main lobby.
5196	3.2	a	The center contains a concert hall with acclaimed acoustics, theaters, a library, an exhibition gallery, shops, restaurants, and bars.
5197	3.14	a	The theater presents “sky shows” and IMAX films.
5198	3.0	a	The Hong Kong Museum of Art (see page 54) stands behind the Space Museum next to the cultural center.
5199	3.1	a	It contains the Xubaizhi collection of painting and calligraphy; galleries devoted to antiquities and ceramics; and a gallery of modern Chinese art.
5200	3.43	a	Particularly interesting is the collection of paintings and photographs of old Hong Kong.
5201	3.1	a	A few blocks up Chatham Road South are two more major museums.
5202	3.11	a	The Scien­ce Mus­eum (see page 55) is a state-of-the-art interactive museum that will teach you how everything and anything works from ancient sailing ships to the latest technology.
5203	3.0	a	Go through the underground walkway to Statue Square; on the east side of the square is the Legislative Council Building, one of the few colonial buildings left in Hong Kong.
5204	3.1	a	Just across Salisbury Road from the cultural center is the historic Peninsula Hotel, now expanded and modernized by a 32-story tower.
5205	3.4	a	Its restored lobby is Hong Kong’s most elegant gathering place; afternoon tea here is a visitors’ ritual.
5206	3.2	a	Alongside the hotel runs busy Nathan Road, Hong Kong’s fabled shopping street, lined with shops, hotels, and restaurants.
5207	3.0	a	Kowloon’s main street was created by Sir Matthew Nathan when he was governor of Hong Kong at the turn of the 19th century.
5208	2.88	a	At the time it was built, many thought it absurd to have a tree-lined boulevard running through what was practically a wilderness.
5209	3.0	a	Now the former “Nathan’s Folly” is known as the “Golden Mile. ”
5210	3.2	a	A few blocks up Nathan Road is Kowloon Park (open daily 6am–midnight), elegantly laid out with fountains, promenades, and ornamental gardens; be sure to go up the steps to see the Sculpture Walk.
5211	3.0	a	Farther up Nathan Street you will reach Yau Ma Tei, one of the older parts of Kowloon.
5212	3.0	a	Turn off Nathan and walk down Kansu Street to find the Jade Market (open 10am–3pm; see page 80), with more than 100 stalls spread out in a large tent, just before you reach the overpass.
5213	3.0	a	Hong Kong’s liveliest market scene is the Temple Street Night Market (see page 55), near Jordan Road.
5214	3.3	a	Everything is sold here, from clothing to souvenirs to electronic goods, and the market is known for its street-side food stalls, where you can dine inexpensively on seafood.
5215	2.9	a	So great is the pressure on the available land that most of Hong Kong’s colonial architectural heritage has been demolished and replaced by new skyscrapers.
5216	3.25	a	The market runs all the way up to Tin Hau Temple, where you will find fortune tellers’ tables (some speak English) and possibly street performers singing Chinese opera or pop songs.
5217	3.5	a	In the daytime the temple (open 8am–6pm) attracts worshipers, and its park attracts strollers and mah-jong players.
5218	3.0	a	Nathan Road goes all the way up to Boundary Street, which marks the boundary between Kowloon and the New Territories.
5219	3.1	a	Birds are favorite pets in Hong Kong, valued for their singing rather than their plumage, and here you’ll find all kinds of birds for sale as well as elaborate teak and bamboo cages.
5220	3.2	a	Off the beaten path in Sham Shui Po, west of the junction of Nathan Road and Boundary Street, is the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb and Museum on Tonkin Road (open Monday–Wednesday and Friday–Saturday 10am–6pm, Sunday 1–6pm; closed Thursday).
5221	3.11	a	This ancient burial vault is believed to date back to the Han Dynasty (a.d. 25–220).
5222	3.0	a	The barrel-vaulted chambers were discovered while excavating for a nearby housing project.
5223	3.38	a	Surprises spring up on all sides: new industrial complexes alongside sleepy farming villages, skyscraper towns blooming in the middle of nowhere, Hakka women in their traditional flat straw hats with hanging black curtains, water buffalo, and flashes of azalea everywhere.
5224	2.7	a	Despite protests by preservationists, there was little alternative.
5225	3.0	a	The New Territories can be explored by taking the Kowloon–Canton Railway (KCR), which makes 10 stops between the station in Kowloon and Sheung Shui, the last stop before entering China.
5226	3.0	a	Ask the tourist authority about its interesting Heritage Tour from Kowloon and other countryside tours (see page 113).
5227	3.1	a	North of the town, a commanding view over all the New Territories to the north can be seen from Tai Mo Shan, Hong Kong’s highest peak at 957 m (3,140 ft).
5228	3.1	a	The highway continues parallel to the coast.
5229	3.1	a	Nearby is Chater Garden and a number of notable architectural landmarks.
5230	3.0	a	One-third of all Hong Kong’s beaches are to be found in a single 14-km (9-mile) stretch of this region’s shoreline.
5231	3.0	a	Place names are often based on the distance to the nearest mile-post, as measured from the tip of the Kowloon peninsula.
5232	3.4	a	As you approach the border, you can glimpse the skyscrapers of Shenzhen.
5233	3.0	a	The lookout point at Lok Ma Chau was once known as Hong Kong’s “window on China” — in the years of China’s isolation from the West, tourists would come to the lookout point here and rent binoculars in order to get a glimpse of the great mystery beyond.
5234	2.8	a	Most famous is the striking 74-story I.M. Pei Bank of China Tower, not beloved by the people of Hong Kong — its triangular prisms and sharp angles violate the principles of feng shui (see box, page 68) and its radio masts stick up like an insect’s antennae.
5235	3.0	a	Set amid Tseun Wan’s residential towers is the 18th-century walled village of Sam Tung Uk, now preserved as a museum, and a short walk from the MTR station.
5236	3.0	a	Not far away, at milepost 21 near the large new town of Tuen Mun, is a Taoist retreat known as Ching Chung Koon.
5237	3.12	a	This “Temple of Green Pines” is a spacious complex containing temples and pavilions, statues, and gardens.
5238	3.2	a	It is known for its collection of bonsai and houses a jade seal more than 1,000 years old.
5239	3.18	a	An even more interesting image out of Chinese history is the walled village of Kat Hing Wai, in the village of Kam Tin just outside the market town of Yuen Long.
5240	3.0	a	This is the most easily accessible of the New Territories’ walled villages.
5241	3.0	a	It is built in a square, and the only way in is through the gate in the brick defensive wall.
5242	2.9	a	Kat Hing Wai was built four or five centuries ago by the Hakka Tang clan, one of the Five Great Clans that migrated here from North China (see page 11).
5243	3.1	a	Many of the old houses in the village have been replaced by modern structures.
5244	3.0	a	The Tang clan’s earliest walled village was Lo Wai, which also has its defensive wall intact and is entered by a narrow gate.
5245	3.0	a	Few traditional ancestral halls remain in China since the anti-historical destruction during the Cultural Revolution, so these New Territories ancestral halls are rare survivors.
5246	3.0	a	Another such hall, belonging to the Liu Clan, is Liu Man Shek Tong in the village of Sheung Shui.
5247	3.22	a	One of the most interesting sites in the New Territories is Tai Fu Tai, another rare survivor, this one a mansion that belonged to a Confucian high official.
5248	3.2	a	The house was built in 1865 by a member of the Man clan who achieved the rank of tai fu (mandarin) by doing well in the Imperial Exam­inations.
5249	3.12	a	The traditional Qing Dyna­sty style of the mansion is enlivened by a few West­ern touches: a Baroque-style ceiling and stained glass above the doorways, showing the builder’s up-to-date attitude at the time of construction.
5250	2.91	a	Tai Po, just south of Fanling, is known for its market, Tai Po Market, which buzzes with activity daily from 7am to 6pm.
5251	3.0	a	The rival Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank is by architect Norman Foster; built on a “coathanger frame,” its floors hang rather than ascend.
5252	3.2	a	The railway line then curves gracefully around Tolo Harbor, an idyllic body of water well-protected from the open sea.
5253	3.22	a	The boats go on to the friendly fishermen’s island of Tap Mun, in Mirs Bay, with stops in remote hamlets of the Sai Kung Peninsula.
5254	3.0	a	The Sai Kung area is the location of two official parks and nature preserves, while on the south side of the peninsula are some of the territory’s best beaches.
5255	3.29	a	From the next railway station, the modern campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong is visible.
5256	3.0	a	Teaching here is conducted in both Chinese and English.
5257	3.2	a	The Art Gallery in the Institute of Chinese Studies Building is worth a visit for its painting and calligraphy collections.
5258	3.0	a	Sha Tin is the site of the Monastery of 10,000 Buddhas, which looks down on a burgeoning town.
5259	3.0	a	There are hundreds of stone steps in the hillside to walk up before you reach Man Fat Temple with its regiments of small gilt statues of Buddha lining the walls.
5260	3.1	a	From inside the vast atrium you can view the whole structure as well as the mechanical workings of the building.
5261	3.12	a	There is a total of 12,800 Buddha statues here, plus the remains of the monastery’s founder embalmed in gold leaf.
5262	3.09	a	Also here is the Hongkong Heritage Museum (call Tel. 2180 8188 for open hours).
5263	3.1	a	The museum has an art collection, and displays of toys and other artifacts.
5264	3.75	a	Down to earth, the Sha Tin Racecourse can accommodate over 80,000 spectators and is equipped with every imaginable luxury, including a giant video screen facing the stands, and for the horses, air-conditioned stables.
5265	3.14	a	Opposite the Sha Tin railway station, New Town Plaza features shops, cinemas, and even a computer-controlled musical fountain.
5266	3.12	a	Two natural rock formations are always pointed out on excursions.
5267	2.9	a	Two bronze lions, carrying out feng shui principles, guard its doors.
5268	3.33	a	It really looks the part; the tourists know its name even before the guide can translate it.
5269	3.3	a	Excursion companies sell a variety of orientation cruises of Hong Kong harbor that include a look at some of its 235 outlying islands.
5270	3.25	a	These pleasant, but expensive, outings can lay the foundation for your own explorations aboard the cheap but usually comfortable ferries used by the islanders themselves.
5271	3.2	a	You can catch one of Hong Kong’s historic trams along Des Voeux Road and ride from Central to Causeway Bay (see box, page 66).
5272	3.0	a	At 934 m (3,064 ft), Lantau Peak is high enough to attract the occasional rain cloud — refreshingly cool breezes blow on most hot summer days.
5273	3.0	a	Ferries depart from Central every two hours between 6:10am and 10:30pm to Silvermine Bay (Mui Wo), where a bus terminal has buses to all parts of the island.

5477	3.1	a	The Foshan Art Porcelain Factory has traditional designs, but also some attractive modern pieces.
5478	3.1	a	Foshan’s most outstanding artistic monument is Zu Miao, the Taoist Ancestral Temple, a Sung dynasty establishment rebuilt in the 14th century and well worth visiting.
5479	3.4	a	Constructed in wood, brick, stone, ceramic, and bronze, this is a work of extravagant beauty, uniting many ancient art forms.
5480	3.11	a	Shenzhen was China’s first Special Economic Zone.
5481	3.0	a	Literally created out of rural farmland, it was set up in the 1970s as the answer to Hong Kong.
5482	3.22	a	From a population of 20,000 it has grown into a metropolis of 2.5 million, with tightly clustered skyscrapers and some of China’s highest grossing industries.
5483	3.12	a	It is even becoming something of a commuter town — owning or renting an apartment here costs a fraction of what it would in Hong Kong.
5484	3.0	a	A Turbo Cat ferry makes a one-hour trip (7am–7pm) from Hong Kong’s Macau Ferry Terminal to Shekou on the Natau Peninsula, which is part of the economic zone.
5485	3.1	a	Shenzhen is a premier shopping center, and much cheaper than Hong Kong.
5486	3.2	a	It is known for its inexpensive (but well-made) knock-off designer goods.
5487	3.17	a	The view is especially effective at night.
5488	3.2	a	You can use your Hong Kong dollars here, so there’s no need to change currency.
5489	3.3	a	Some places take credit cards, but cash is better for bargaining.
5490	3.4	a	Shenzhen’s main tourist attractions are its enormous theme parks.
5491	3.1	a	There are also souvenir stands, benches for a rest, and perhaps Hong Kong’s last surviving rickshaws — however these are not for rides, but are a tourist photo opportunity.
5492	3.4	a	It contains elaborate replicas of China’s chief monuments in impressive detail, including a scaled-down version of the Great Wall.
5493	3.2	a	The 24 China Folk Culture Villages represent China’s ethnic variety; they feature craftspeople in traditional costumes along with folksong and dance performances.
5494	3.25	a	In Shekou is a large Free Market, and an exhibition of Xian’s terra-cotta warriors.
5495	3.18	a	If you’re up to a climb, take the Mount Austin road to the Victoria Peak Gardens.
5496	2.88	a	These gardens used to belong to the governor’s mountain lodge, but the building was demolished by the Japanese during the occupation of Hong Kong.
5497	3.1	a	From the lower terminal of the Peak Tram it’s only a short walk to the former governor’s residence, Government House, now a museum.
5498	3.62	a	Across from the mansion, the Zoological and Botanical Gardens (gardens open daily 6am–10pm; zoo 6am–7pm; admission free) provide a welcome oasis amid the big-city pressures.
5499	3.1	a	In the very early morning the park is taken over by people doing tai-chi exercises.
5500	3.1	a	Both young and old go through ballet-like movements in slow motion to discipline the mind and body.
5501	3.4	a	The park’s zoo has a collection of weird and wonderful chattering jungle birds.
5502	3.2	a	The Western District is one of Hong Kong’s oldest neighborhoods, and its narrow streets hold a collection of fascinating traditional shops and enterprises.
5503	3.14	a	Opposite the Macau Ferry Terminal you’ll find the Western Market (open 10am–7pm).
5504	3.2	a	It is more interesting for its architecture than for its shopping; it’s situated in a four-story Edwardian building built in 1906.
5505	3.2	a	For an interesting glimpse of small and family-owned shops, walk along Bonham Strand East and West, Man Wa Lane, and Cleverly Street.
5506	3.0	a	When it opened in 1912, the university had a total of 72 students.
5507	3.3	a	The University’s Fung Ping Shan Museum, 94 Bonham Road (open Monday–Saturday 9:30am–6pm, admission free) holds a significant collection of antiquities: bronzes, dating from 3000 b.c. , and ceramics, including Han Dynasty tomb pottery.
5508	3.4	a	It also has the world’s largest collection of Nestorian crosses from the Yuan Dynasty period.
5509	3.2	a	Here the windows and open doors of the shops reveal an alluring selection of Asian furniture, carpets, carvings, tomb figures, porcelain, and bronze.
5510	3.0	a	Walk west along Hollywood Road until you come to Man Mo Temple, the island’s oldest house of worship (though the date of its founding is subject to dispute).
5511	3.12	a	Visitors entering the temple are confronted by a dense pall of smoke from all the burning joss sticks and the incense coils hanging from the ceiling (these will burn for as long as a month).
5512	3.3	a	Contributions to the Annual Fund help us to prepare our master’s students with a thorough knowledge of their discipline, as well as the needed skills for success in the workplace.
5513	3.2	a	They enable us to provide students with access to state-of-the-art technology and opportunities to attend professional colloquia, seminars, and conferences on and off campus.
5514	3.25	a	Your support of the Graduate School’s Annual Fund is critical to maintaining the core values of GSAS: rigorous inquiry, the lifelong discovery of ideas, and our commitment to the ethics of scholarship.
5515	3.1	a	We also hope you have been able to follow the public education campaign for our master’s programs in The New York Times and elsewhere, a sign of our belief in them.
5516	3.1	a	Your gift reinforces our emphasis on these ideals that have distinguished the Graduate School of Arts and Science as a preeminent center for advanced learning since 1886.
5517	3.5	a	I am grateful for your continued partnership in our pursuit of these shared values.

5522	3.1	a	NEW YORK UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE OFFICE OF THE DEAN
5523	3.12	a	Dear Ms. LastName
5524	3.6	a	Over the past year, the Graduate School of Arts and Science has seen record level contributions from its alumni and alumnae to the School’s Annual Fund.
5525	3.6	a	This response is a marvelous endorsement of the work of our students, faculty, and staff.
5526	3.4	a	As you read the enclosed Dean 's Report and Request, I hope you will consider how your support of the Graduate School’s Annual Fund shapes the lives of its faculty and students as it makes an impact on the depth and breadth of their NYU experience.
5527	3.0	a	However, it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate, as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility, and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution (Warren 2002: 159, 172).
5528	3.1	a	Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key.
5529	3.0	a	This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia.
5530	3.0	a	In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued, but serves to split the population, both between groups and within groups themselves.
5531	3.1	a	Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture.
5532	3.0	a	Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed, often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and non-governmental organizations.
5533	2.9	a	The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves: the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with.
5534	3.11	a	Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has. In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia.
5535	2.57	a	When a punishment - often public and corporal in nature - is carried out, the group feels the effects as a whole.
5536	3.0	a	(Rappaport 2005) Once punishments are completed, the criminal is seen as rehabilitated, having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order, and is welcomed back into the community (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 61, Rappaport 2005: 97).
5537	2.9	a	Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task, as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision.
5538	2.9	a	This provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the Spanish Colombian culture, and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing (Rappaport 2005: 93, 236).
5539	3.25	a	Translation fulfills another vital role, as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself.
5540	2.88	a	Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge, distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries.
5541	2.9	a	The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature; Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten (Rappaport 2005: 165).
5542	2.9	a	This attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use.
5543	2.9	a	Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers, raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use.
5544	3.0	a	The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great, leading to the difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought.
5545	3.0	a	In addition, there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity; the Nasa, for example, divide themselves into the traditional, modern, and new.
5546	2.8	a	The authenticity of the modern Nasa, who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots, is brought into question by the traditional, who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existence(Rappaport 2005).
5547	2.89	a	Illiteracy and poverty is associated with Maya; thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique Mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions, which most often occurs under Spanish influence.
5548	2.9	a	A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic “Indianness”, both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture.
5549	3.0	a	Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their “indigenous identity”, and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages.
5550	3.0	a	Efforts towards development, then, cannot endanger traditional culture and values, for fear of losing cultural legitimacy (Jackson 1995: 5).
5551	3.1	a	There develops a duality in native culture; for example, many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom.
5552	3.0	a	An emphasis on preserving, rather than practicing, native culture arises: indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a day-to-day basis (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 66-67).
5553	2.9	a	This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed.
5554	2.9	a	In Guatemala, they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress; the pan-Mayan movement must meet the dual trials of establishing a positive identity within the Mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law.
5555	3.0	a	In Colombia, legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian government's recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife, and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not (Jackson 1995: 8).
5556	3.0	a	Regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status, indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws (Jackson 1995: 5).
5557	2.8	a	Conflicts arise due to internal differences and the ever-persist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in a pluralistic linguistic environment.
5558	2.9	a	Works Cited
5559	2.86	a	The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far-reaching and deeply embedded in both countries.
5560	2.9	a	One of the most prominent, lasting influences is that of the land grant system. Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system, in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land.
5561	2.9	a	This was in turn replaced by the repartimento; the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish, providing labor and taxes as demanded.
5562	2.89	a	Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others.
5563	2.8	a	In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers.
5564	3.1	a	Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations; previously, both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture.
5565	2.4	a	In Colombia this resulted in a civil war between the Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party.
5566	2.4	a	A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists, who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response.
5567	2.4	a	Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples.
5568	3.09	a	This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those “outside” them, those who do not belong.
5569	2.6	a	This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population. In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples; in many cases there were coalitions, but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts.
5570	3.2	a	The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord (Warren 2002: 157-158).
5571	2.9	a	By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82).
5572	3.0	a	Central to these was the question of indigenous identity:
5573	3.1	a	Pan-Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language; despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people.
5574	3.1	a	Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739).
5575	2.9	a	The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the (often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181).
5576	2.86	a	A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society.
5577	2.9	a	This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism: Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility, whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior.
5578	3.0	a	By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority.
5579	3.0	a	"Colombia, in contrast, has no unified ""pan-Indian"" sentiments; the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population, a fractured entity divided by region and language."
5580	3.0	a	Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85).
5581	3.0	a	One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language.
5582	3.0	a	The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal, is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples (Jackson 2003: 82).
5583	2.75	a	It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84).
5584	3.0	a	The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2).
5585	3.3	a	This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other.
5586	3.12	a	The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry.
5587	2.7	a	"In the 1990s the rhetoric of ""cultural diversity"" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole."
5588	3.12	a	A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991, which includes a section on indigenous rights, as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57).
5589	2.9	a	Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty.
5590	3.0	a	The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity:
5591	3.1	a	no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era.
5592	3.1	a	In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers.
5593	3.27	a	Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158).

5664	2.75	a	As a person who cares about animals, you’re probably anxious to know what happened to Astro.
5665	2.71	a	A neighbor reported Astro’s plight to the ASPCA and our Humane Law Enforcement officers went to investigate.
5666	2.63	a	When our officers arrived, Astro was too weak to even stand up.
5667	2.67	a	The officers knelt down slowly, speaking gently to the emaciated dog.
5668	3.1	a	Then they saw it.
5669	3.78	a	Astro was wagging his tail.
5670	2.6	a	He was barely moving.
5671	3.8	a	“Welcome, friends!”
5672	2.8	a	The officers brought Astro to the ASPCA’s Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital.
5673	2.11	a	The dog weighted only 45 pounds -- less than half of what a dog his size should weigh -- and he had several infections.
5674	3.7	a	But with first-rate medical attention and tender care from ASPCA staff, he slowly got well again.
5675	3.0	a	Stories like Astro’s are all too common.
5676	2.11	a	Every day, the ASPCA gets reports of animal cruelty, abuse, and neglect.
5677	2.6	a	Every day, our officers rescue animals like Sammy, a 10-month-old kitten who was deliberately thrown from a high-rise window by teenagers.
5678	2.7	a	In a world where cruelty is common, animals like Sammy and Astro desperately need friends like you.
5679	3.0	a	That is why I have written to you -- to ask you to support the ASPCA today.
5680	3.14	a	Our vital anti-cruelty efforts are just part of the ASPCA mission. We also find loving adoptive homes for rescued animals ... provide first-rate veterinary care through our Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital ... offer low-cost spay and neuter programs for cats and dogs ... reach out to children, teachers, and parents through our Education Programs.
5681	3.2	a	And we don’t stop there.
5682	3.43	a	The ASPCA pushes for the passage and strengthening of anti-cruelty laws, so that crimes against animals will be treated with the seriousness they deserve.
5683	2.7	a	At least Astro could drink water from a puddle near the stake he was chained to.
5684	2.36	a	Today, over 130 years later, the scope of the problem is greater than ever.
5685	2.44	a	The ASPCA urgently needs your help to push back the tide of violence against animals.
5686	3.11	a	THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
5687	3.1	a	That is why I’m asking you to join the ASPCA today with your gift of $20 or more if at all possible.
5688	3.43	a	Your contribution will help us rescue more animals like Astro ... make sure the perpetrators of cruelty are brought to justice ... nurse abused animals back to health and find them loving adoptive homes.
5689	2.9	a	Sincerely, Hawk, DVM and CEO
5690	2.7	a	But then the puddle dried up.
5691	3.6	a	P.S.We found Astro a wonderful adoptive home.
5692	4.0	a	He is the pride and joy of this loving family!
5693	3.6	a	Please accept the enclosed name stickers as our gift to you and use them to spread the word about the ASPCA and the animals we help -- thank you.

5696	3.5	a	Dear Friend:
5697	2.2	a	As you read my letter, somewhere -- perhaps not far from you --someone is inflicting pain on an innocent animal ... an animal like Astro.

5724	2.5	a	Let me tell you exactly what’s at stake ... and how this could set a dangerous precedent: First of all, you might wonder why blackbirds are not benefiting from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act’s prohibition against actions that cause intentional harm.
5725	2.9	a	So they applied for the right to spread poison as Dart of a “scientific experiment” -- to learn whether lowering the population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss.
5726	3.0	a	“scientific experiment”
5727	3.14	a	Can you believe it?
5728	2.4	a	The USDA wants to conduct an “experiment” that will spread enough poison in our environment to kill two million blackbirds.
5729	2.9	a	“experiment”
5730	2.6	a	And if the death of two million birds doesn’t “prove” their theory -- and show a reduction in crop loss -- they’ll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year!
5731	3.0	a	“prove”
5732	3.0	a	It’s time to tell the USDA, in no uncertain terms:
5733	2.44	a	“YOU WILL NOT CONDUCT MASSIVE BIRD KILLS TO BENEFIT A HANDFUL OF SPECIAL INTERESTS!”
5734	2.2	a	Because the USDA’s slow-acting pesticide takes three days to kill, its victims will likely fly many miles from the poisoned fields, before falling to the ground.
5735	2.7	a	Meanwhile,blackbirds aren’t the only birds threatened directly by the poison.
5736	2.78	a	In all, nine birds on the Federal threatened or endangered lists and 11 birds on Audubon’s WatchList of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields.
5737	3.17	a	Here’s what I need you to do, to make sure we prevail: First, I need you to sign and return your Petition to the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.
5738	3.0	a	I’ll forward your Petition, along with those from thousands of other Audubon members and supporters, urging the USDA to withdraw its cruel plan to poison blackbirds ... in favor of alternative, benign methods of protecting sunflower crops.
5739	3.6	a	I can assure you that thousands of Audubon Petitions can make a difference -- just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago!
5740	2.88	a	But today’s battle is one we must win ... to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase 50 years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment.
5741	3.0	a	That’s why I hope you’ll also agree to help even more by making a tax-deductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of Audubon’s vital conservation work to protect birds, other wildlife and habitat.
5742	2.0	a	And who plans to commit such a mass bird killing?
5743	3.2	a	I’ll make sure your gift is put right to work in our efforts to:
5744	3.3	a	·Win a ban on the USDA bird poisoning.
5745	3.0	a	·Ensure wildlife programs are based on sound science.
5746	3.0	a	·Monitor the health of Audubon’s WatchList species.
5747	3.1	a	And Audubon will draw upon its century-long track record of highly effective conservation work to make a real difference in other key areas:
5748	3.12	a	Your help will be instrumental to our bird conservation work: designating Important Bird Areas to protect vital habitat ... maintaining the WatchList of bird species near endangered status (www.audubon.org/ bird/watch) ... and engaging citizen participation in the vast BirdSource database of North American bird trends.
5749	3.2	a	Audubon rescues endangered wildlife.
5750	3.3	a	Nearly 25 years ago, the National Audubon Society helped win passage of the Endangered Species Act.
5751	2.2	a	In fact, the USDA has plans to spread poisoned rice in sunflower fields throughout the northern Great Plains targeting two million migrating blackbirds and threatening nearly 70 other bird species.
5752	3.46	a	Audubon establishes and protects wildlife refuges and sanctuaries.
5753	3.4	a	And your support will help sustain our innovative Audubon Refuge Keepers program, and maintain our own network of more than 100 wildlife centers and sanctuaries.
5754	1.63	a	I’m outraged ...
5755	3.22	a	Audubon restores wetlands.
5756	3.1	a	Wetlands are not only crucial to wildlife ... they also help purify our drinking water and prevent billions of dollars worth of flood damage.
5757	3.3	a	Your gift today will help us reach our goal to restore one million acres of irreplaceable wetlands.
5758	3.3	a	Audubon educates the public.
5759	3.4	a	Teaching Americans --particularly young people -- how to become better stewards of our environment is one of the best investments that you and I can make for wildlife.
5760	3.1	a	And of course, your support will enable Audubon to stand ready to act whenever a wildlife crisis emerges --like the USDA’s bird poisoning proposal that I’m asking you to help us defeat today!
5761	2.7	a	First,sign and return your Petition to the Secretary of Agriculture immediately, to declare a firm and resounding “NO!”
5762	2.0	a	“NO!”
5763	2.5	a	to the USDA’s bird poisoning plan.
5764	3.2	a	And I also hope you’ll take a second important step today, by supporting Audubon’s vital conservation work with a generous tax-deductible gift.
5765	3.63	a	Thank you.
5766	3.66	a	P.S.Your gift will help us save birds, other wildlife and their habitat for future generations to cherish.
5767	3.2	a	And in thanks for your gift of $15 or more, you 11 receive a FREE Birdfeeder.
5768	3.5	a	and I think you will be, too!
5769	2.5	a	it’s almost unthinkable that a program this reckless could be implemented -- in view of the tragic impact that poisonous chemicals and pesticides like DDT have had on wildlife and people.

5792	3.7	a	P.S. On behalf of everyone here at the National Audubon Society, we look forward to saying, “Welcome back!”
5793	2.62	a	So this morning I sat down and thought about what it would take for you to give us a second chance.

5801	3.0	a	Medicine for one's mind
5802	3.08	a	The first evening, the twenty-something students--most from my college, four from another--gathered in the shrine room, sitting cross-legged on cushions as we listened to Khenpo Kalsang introduce Tibetan Buddhist philosophy.
5803	3.1	a	"He began by telling us, ""Do not take any of what I say on faith."
5804	3.0	a	"""Do not take any of what I say on faith. Take it through analysis, if there is some benefit in it for you."""
5805	3.0	a	"Take it through analysis, if there is some benefit in it for you."""
5806	2.9	a	Religion, he said, is like a drugstore full of medicine.
5807	3.0	a	You do not go to the drugstore and buy everything in it--you just buy what would be beneficial to you now.
5808	3.0	a	You believe the other medicine may have just as much value, but in other situations, not this one.
5809	2.92	a	When we talked about the giving, and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient beings (in the form of material items, kind words, protection, and so on), Khenpo Kalsang shared a story of the Buddha, and how the Buddha had given his flesh so that a family of hungry tigers could eat.
5810	3.2	a	The gentle wind makes them flutter.
5811	3.0	a	"""So,"""
5812	2.9	a	"""So,"" a fellow student asked, ""Giving one's life for another being is the ultimate gift?"""
5813	3.0	a	"""Giving one's life for another being is the ultimate gift?"""
5814	3.3	a	Khenpo Kalsang, he smiled, and shook his head.
5815	3.0	a	"""Only if you feel no regret,"" he said."
5816	3.0	a	Tibetan Buddhist Retreat
5817	3.2	a	Orange-gold light filters into the grassy meadow, touching a row of canvas tents and the temple house beyond.
5818	2.9	a	"""If you feel regret, it destroys the merit."""
5819	2.9	a	Until then, preserve your own life, and do not give away anything that would cause you regret.
5820	2.7	a	This struck a chord.
5821	3.1	a	Self-preservation above all else, unless the right situation arises.
5822	3.0	a	Later, I talked to the resident nun, Ani Kunga, about psychology and cognitive science.
5823	3.0	a	She had studied psychology for a while in grad school, but now holds the view that psychologists are going about understanding the mind and understanding the knower and what knowing is the wrong way.
5824	2.9	a	"""Psychologists,"""
5825	3.0	a	"""Psychologists,"" she said, ""study the brain and the self externally."
5826	3.0	a	Ever since the 1920s, their science has been about observation of behavior, questionnaires, recordings of electrical brain activity.
5827	3.0	a	"But the mind can only be known by you, the person whose mind it is."""
5828	3.0	a	She said philosophy and epistemology were doing it right: looking at experiences from the inside.
5829	3.0	a	A big overlap exists between Tibetan Buddhism, psychology and cognitive science.
5830	3.0	a	All three examine the distinction between the self and others, between the observer and the observed, between knowing and the knower.
5831	3.0	a	Tsechen Kunchab Ling : Temple of All-Encompassing Great Compassion.
5832	3.0	a	I agree with Ani Kunga to some extent--only so much can be known about the mind from external observation.
5833	3.0	a	But this doesn't mean that there isn't merit to such studies, nor that nothing of use can be learned in that way.
5834	3.0	a	During a second philsophy session, Khenpo Kalsang translated a sutra about a king who received advice from the Buddha.
5835	2.9	a	This sutra delved into some questions about the nature of the self, whether the self is a delusion, and how the clinging of self is a defilement.
5836	3.1	a	I intend to discuss it in more depth later, so stay tuned.
5837	3.0	a	This is the seat of His Holiness the Sakya Trizin in the United States, a Tibetan Buddhist monastery established nine years ago.
5838	2.9	a	Compassion training and prayer flags
5839	3.5	a	Sunshine melted lazily through the tree branches above, a breeze animating the branches' shadows so they danced between our cushions.
5840	3.0	a	Compassion and anger were the session's topics.
5841	3.0	a	The key message:
5842	2.7	a	"""If there's something you can do, why are you unhappy?"
5843	2.8	a	"""If there's something you can do, why are you unhappy? Just do it. If there's nothing you can do, why are you unhappy?"""
5844	3.1	a	Just do it.
5845	2.8	a	"If there's nothing you can do, why are you unhappy?"""
5846	3.0	a	Stay tuned for a more in-depth post on the topic.
5847	3.08	a	Another of the day's activities was making prayer flags.
5848	3.3	a	"As Ani Kunga explained, ""Prayers, wishes, hopes, aspirations--someone, many people, may share those with you."
5849	3.1	a	"""Prayers, wishes, hopes, aspirations--someone, many people, may share those with you. Hanging the prayer flag shares your prayer with everyone else in the world. This may do no good at all, but it may--if everyone hopes and wishes and dreams and aspires, perhaps it will do good. It may not. But if no one shares their prayers, it will certainly do no good. So on the offchance that it will help, why not?"""
5850	3.2	a	Hanging the prayer flag shares your prayer with everyone else in the world.
5851	3.4	a	This may do no good at all, but it may--if everyone hopes and wishes and dreams and aspires, perhaps it will do good.
5852	3.0	a	It may not.
5853	2.6	a	But if no one shares their prayers, it will certainly do no good.
5854	3.2	a	"So on the offchance that it will help, why not?"""
5855	2.58	a	Never done
5856	3.2	a	This weekend reminded me that I'm not done learning.

5861	2.9	a	Faded squares of fabric, strung together in repeating blue-white-red-green-yellow chains, crisscross the branches of bare-limbed trees.
5862	3.4	a	Everyone I've talked to who has previously attended says wonderful things about it; this semester, one of my friends told me she was going: I should join her!
5863	3.6	a	I like learning new things, so I signed up.
5864	3.1	a	A good decision: I didn't return all chill and zen, as one friend told me his roommate had, but I certainly gained a few new ideas and approaches to mull over, and dipped my hand into a previously unfamiliar piece of the world.
5865	3.0	a	They suggested that what you believe about self-control affects the goals you set and achieve [PDF].
5866	3.0	a	I'm not one to make New Year's resolutions.
5867	3.0	a	"In the paper, ""self-control"" is used to mean a sense of willpower."
5868	2.9	a	"""self-control"""
5869	3.1	a	I mean, sure, I could take my pick of popular New Year's resolutions ; I could decide, on the first day of the new year, that this year, I'll start exercising more and eating better, or that I'll spend more time with my family and friends, or that I'll learn a new skill.
5870	3.1	a	An important premise to note here is the idea that the probability of choosing a goal or making a resolution increases if a person thinks that goal can be attained.
5871	3.3	a	So if you think you'll be able to achieve a goal, you're more likely to set it.
5872	3.1	a	Combine this with theories of self-control, and in general, if you believe you have unlimited stores of self-control, you'll set a larger number of goals.
5873	2.73	a	If you believe self-control is malleable but limited, you'll set fewer goals.
5874	3.0	a	Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani also discuss self-efficacy: belief in one's capabilities, the perceived ability to carry out a desired action.
5875	3.0	a	They propose that people with high self-efficacy--people who believe that failure is the result of insufficient effort, and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence--will achieve more of their goals than people with low self-efficacy, who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability, and thus may simply give up.
5876	2.9	a	Self-control, Self-efficacy, and New Year's Resolutions Unresolved
5877	3.0	a	In the first study, 85 participants (all college students) each read one of four passages presenting lay theories of self-control.
5878	3.1	a	Each passage contained two paragraphs; the first discussed self-control either as limited or as unlimited, and the second discussed self-control as either malleable or fixed.
5879	3.1	a	The participants then answered questions about their belief in each of two theories presented, followed by a second questionnaire to assess motivation, in which they listed all their current goals.
5880	2.9	a	The experimenters had some concerns about participants' natural beliefs in relation to the passages they read, however, so in study two, the order of the two measures (lay theories and motivation/goal listing) was varied.
5881	3.0	a	Data from 130 new participants revealed that, as hypothesized, if the motivation & goals questionnaire were assessed first, then among the people who believed self-control is malleable, those who also believed self-control to be unlimited (vs.
5882	3.0	a	limited) set more goals.
5883	3.0	a	When lay theories were assessed first, this result reversed.
5884	3.0	a	The people who believed that self-control is fixed were unaffected by order.
5885	3.1	a	The third study moved on to examine goal achievement, adding a measure to look at self-efficacy.
5886	3.0	a	The study had two sessions, in November then February.
5887	2.9	a	And if I chose to make resolutions, I'd be far from alone--a 2008 survey on Dorthy.com found that 66% of the 2000+ adults polled had made resolutions at some point (though only 17% managed to keep them).
5888	3.2	a	Only 86 participants successfully returned for the second session, during which they indicated how much success they had had at keeping their resolutions.
5889	3.0	a	The resolutions made by participants across all conditions were qualitatively similar (take a look at any list of popular New Year's resolutions, and you'll see the majority of the goals).
5890	3.0	a	As shown in the first two studies, more goals were set by people who believe self-control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people--that is, if you expect more success, you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself.
5891	2.9	a	As far as success goes, only the interaction between lay theory and self-efficacy was significant.
5892	2.7	a	If participants believed in limited self-control and were low in self-efficacy, they tended to give up more often, failing to achieve their goals.
5893	3.09	a	But if participants believed in unlimited self-control, self-efficacy had no effect; participants achieved just as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed.
5894	3.0	a	Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay theories of self-control and beliefs about one's own amount of self-control and self-efficacy, and propose this as an area for future study.
5895	3.1	a	But in general, lay theories about self-control can determine how much success you'll expect (and thus, how many goals you'll set), and self-efficacy beliefs can determine how much success you'll actually have.

5901	2.9	a	Making resolutions: It's about self-control
5902	3.0	a	The question Anirban Mukhopadhyay of the Hong Kong University and Gita Venkatarmani Johar of the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University asked is this: What determines how many goals a person will set, and how successful a person will be at achieving those goals?
5903	3.0	a	They performed a few studies in 2005 to look at the relationship between self-control, goal setting, and goal achievement.
5904	3.0	a	Several boards were missing, making a door to the small room inside.
5905	2.1	a	"""You suck."" Chad said."
5906	3.0	a	Chad checked the other fort out of the corner of his eye.
5907	3.0	a	"He wished Roy wouldn't fall for that gag every time, ""get me a big rock, Roy."""
5908	3.0	a	A massive, rusted A-frame swing marked the border though nobody was swinging in the hot sun.
5909	3.0	a	The larger of the two forts was a squat black bunker made of tires, two big tractor tires capped with one from a truck and two smaller ones from cars.
5910	3.2	a	The older boys lay around in shade and napped inside the walls.
5911	2.6	a	Chad wished he were old enough to be one of them.
5912	3.17	a	Maybe Tucker would let him in after he saw Chad wasn't chicken.
5913	3.14	a	"""You wanna play robots?"" Roy asked."
5914	3.0	a	You wanna play robots?
5915	3.0	a	Chad felt his heart beat a little faster and his cheeks burned.
5916	2.78	a	"He had invented the ""robots"" game to make fun of Roy, but Roy had never figured that out either."
5917	3.0	a	Roy stooped to pick up a big, white caliche rock that looked like a dirty lump of chalk and handed it to Chad.
5918	3.43	a	It was Roy's favorite game.
5919	3.0	a	No, go get some stickers.
5920	3.0	a	He thought about gathering stickers himself.
5921	2.7	a	Roy was too slow, but he didn't dare step away from his fort.
5922	3.0	a	He took another careful look over his shoulder and bent to pluck a yucca spear as if that were what drew his interest.
5923	3.0	a	The long blade of the yucca had a sharp tip, but the only weapons allowed according to Humpty Dumpty Nursery rules of engagement were smelly thistles or cocklebur stems covered with spiked yellow stickers.
5924	2.7	a	The tiny barbs hurt, but nobody was allowed to beat you up if you just used stickers.
5925	2.8	a	The hot August sun was settling toward the time that Mrs. Rayburn would bring the milk tray out of the cinder block building where the toddlers and babies were kept.
5926	2.9	a	Meanwhile Roy stalked around the fence edge bending to pick cockleburs as he went.
5927	2.4	a	Chad took the rock with disgust as Roy returned to staring at his shoes.
5928	3.1	a	Every move Roy made since the accident was smooth and sudden and strange -- like a remote control boy.
5929	3.25	a	"When he saw Roy in the hospital with a shaved head and the small silver plug at the back of his noggin like a bottle cap, Chad had called him, ""Remote Control Boy."""
5930	2.2	a	Momma had smacked Chad for saying it which hurt, and then she had cried, which was worse.
5931	2.8	a	Pop had given Chad the sideways glance that promised hard labor when they made it home.
5932	2.9	a	He knew it was too late to explain that he was trying to get a smile out of Roy.
5933	3.22	a	"Pop said, ""The doctors have put something very special in Roy's brain."
5934	3.1	a	The doctors have put something very special in Roy's brain.
5935	3.2	a	It's something they made for soldiers and astronauts and it's going to help Roy walk and talk to us again.
5936	2.78	a	Chad was six, and at eight Roy should have been teasing or ordering Chad around or something.
5937	2.9	a	Pop put a hand on Roy's shoulder.
5938	3.0	a	How are you feeling, Roy?
5939	2.8	a	Pop spoke slowly and Chad knew that he must have been practicing this with Roy.
5940	2.25	a	They all stood around while the doctor made Roy shake and jerk and moan with a sick sound.
5941	2.7	a	"But the thing in his head hadn't worked yet because of something having to do with the, ""electric toads,"" which wouldn't, ""sit up."""
5942	3.0	a	Roy didn't really start talking for days and didn't walk until a long time after that.
5943	2.5	a	Now, this year, Roy was in the same grade as Chad, and it was embarrassing.
5944	3.0	a	Just then Tucker Williams came climbing out of the top of the black fort like a gold headed monster.
5945	2.8	a	Tucker was big, even for a third grader, and he was not quite right in a different way than Roy.
5946	2.9	a	Tucker was the oldest boy in the playground, and the one who decided the rules of the game.
5947	2.9	a	But since his fall the year before, Roy had been shuffling and doing what he was told.
5948	2.4	a	"""Time out!"""
5949	2.9	a	"Time out!"" Chad called, ""We're not ready yet."
5950	2.8	a	We're not ready yet.
5951	2.9	a	"""No time outs!"" Tucker shouted and continued to climb down the tires."
5952	3.5	a	Roy!
5953	2.7	a	"Roy!"" Chad called, but his voice would only whisper"
5954	2.25	a	He didn't want to be a crybaby, Tucker hated crybabies.
5955	3.0	a	The rules of the game were that Chad had to keep everyone away from his fort and away from his tumbleweed flag.
5956	2.56	a	Chad strained and pounded the rock into the iron hole until he could smell the dust.
5957	3.0	a	Tucker was standing over him with the huge tumbleweed held high in the sun.
5958	3.0	a	Penis!
5959	2.2	a	You didn't fight!
5960	2.88	a	Chad tried to tell his arms to lift him and let him reach for the tumbleweed to prove he wasn't a baby to Tucker.
5961	2.4	a	I'll make you fight.
5962	2.38	a	Tucker leaned in low and his breath was sour as it blew in Chad's face.
5963	3.0	a	I'm gonna take the plug out.
5964	3.12	a	From his pocket he pulled a small screwdriver, perfect for prying plugs from boy's heads.
5965	2.67	a	"Now Chad's legs and arms and mouth worked, and he was up and running and screaming, ""Roy, go inside! Roy!"""
5966	3.11	a	It smelled like first grade.
5967	3.3	a	Roy!
5968	2.56	a	He sprinted for the corner of the building around which Roy had disappeared.
5969	3.0	a	The door was on that side and Mrs. Rayburn.
5970	2.3	a	Just then a horrible pain stung Chad's cheek and neck and ear.
5971	2.36	a	The tumbleweed's yellow thorned branches scratched around him as it dug into his face.
5972	2.9	a	He wished he were there now, even if he did have to sit next to Roy.
5973	2.7	a	Tucker made a grab for him but missed it, and Chad heard his shirt rip a little.
5974	3.3	a	Roy!
5975	2.82	a	Chad rounded the corner grabbing the cinder block to help him turn faster just as Tucker came down again with the tumbleweed from behind, and the world slowed almost to a stop.
5976	2.78	a	Roy stood with the bill of his cap down.
5977	3.0	a	His head rose and his eyes focused over Chad's shoulder.
5978	3.2	a	Roy held stickers in his hand like flowers, but he bent looking down and snatched something from the ground.
5979	2.6	a	His hand blurred and snapped out as he stood back up.
5980	2.9	a	Something whined as it spun past Chad's ear, and he heard a sharp, meaty thunk just behind him.
5981	3.36	a	The rock was too big to fit into the iron hub of the big cable spool, so Chad leaned it against the tumbleweed and slid down off the splintery wood on his belly to admire his handiwork.
5982	3.1	a	Hey, Roy?
5983	3.0	a	Roy stood expressionless as ever as Chad turned to look.
5984	3.0	a	Tucker towered there with a surprised expression and crossed eyes, the tumbleweed in one hand and the screwdriver held up high in the other ready to stab down into Chad's back.
5985	2.2	a	A sharp, flat, flint rock split Tucker's forehead and was buried deep and solid like a part of a Halloween costume complete with a drop of blood just starting down toward his nose.
5986	2.75	a	Tucker dropped down like a jacket from a hook.
5987	3.0	a	It was Roy, and when Chad looked up there was something like his brother there around the eyes.
5988	3.1	a	Yeah.
5989	2.82	a	Chad stepped back away from Tucker's open-eyed face.
5990	2.3	a	"""I thought he might stab you."" Roy said and craned his neck forward to look at Tucker's face as the other boys began to crowd around at a respectful distance."
5991	2.25	a	I thought he might stab you.
5992	2.6	a	Do you think he's dead?
5993	1.84	a	Just then Tucker blinked and began to sob.
5994	2.62	a	"""Nah."" Chad said, ""We're gonna be in trouble."""
5995	2.75	a	Nah.
5996	2.3	a	We're gonna be in trouble.
5997	3.3	a	"""Yeah."" Roy said."
5998	3.09	a	Yeah.
5999	2.8	a	Suddenly his blank face seemed like the face of a Play Force Soldier or a GI Joe.
6000	3.11	a	Hey, Roy?
6001	3.0	a	What?
6002	2.0	a	You suck.
6003	3.3	a	It was all right.
6004	3.0	a	The fort was a lone, wooden cable spool like a tall barrel with thick disks on its ends, each the size of a dinner table.
6005	2.86	a	What?
6006	3.18	a	So I shall soothe my quarreling selves with a compromise.
6007	2.8	a	I will not talk of the first time Tasha and I tried any act of sex or sport together.
6008	3.0	a	I can remember similar things with others.
6009	3.0	a	Is that love?
6010	2.9	a	Probably not.
6011	4.0	a	But it is something marvelous and rare, which is surely a sign of love.
6012	3.2	a	"If my love for her was the only important thing, I would leave a holo of her with a note: ""Dear Future, this is Tasha Cortez."
6013	3.7	a	You loved her.
6014	2.78	a	Enough.
6015	3.3	a	Tasha and I walked through The Sleeping Flamingo together, and I decided to buy it.
6016	3.1	a	Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection.
6017	3.0	a	Then --
6018	2.29	a	This is not easy.
6019	2.89	a	I stand up, I walk around, I pretend someone makes a vid about a writer and I must enact every cliche.
6020	3.0	a	But I have learned something: writing trivializes.
6021	3.0	a	The Tasha who was is not the Tasha in this file.
6022	2.1	a	The Tasha in this file is not even the Tasha I loved and thought I knew.
6023	2.86	a	The Tasha in this file would walk through a net show in half an hour, including commercials, and just before an ad for Figuero's Flash Diapers -- Keeps Baby Driest!
6024	3.0	a	, she --
6025	2.91	a	Tasha is not the whole of what happened on Vega IV.
6026	3.1	a	Future Self, you know our style well enough to tell that time has passed between the last sentence and this.
6027	3.33	a	I have been re-reading all our favorite books --
6028	3.1	a	Published in Double Feature by Emma Bull and Will Shetterly (NESFA Press, 1994).
6029	3.14	a	But neither of us care to dwell on such boring subjects, do we?
6030	2.5	a	I want to pick up with Tasha and me walking about The Sleeping Flamingo, and then, for the sake of literary convenience, to say that from a corner of the yard I saw a neighboring house, and the sight filled me with darkest forebodings.
6031	2.7	a	But the truth is that Tasha pointed it out from the one place where it could barely be seen, and I only felt envy that it had been designed by someone with understated good taste.
6032	3.0	a	I asked.
6033	2.6	a	"""No one,"""
6034	2.86	a	"""No one,"" Tasha replied."
6035	3.0	a	Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it.
6036	2.8	a	Truth is always more boring than fiction.
6037	3.0	a	how does one speak to one's future self?
6038	3.0	a	-- occupied The Flamingo.
6039	3.0	a	I do not plan to write a book: this narrative must move more quickly.
6040	3.7	a	Tasha and I became lovers that evening, after a good dinner of paella at her apartment.
6041	3.29	a	Consoling her, I began to suspect I loved her.
6042	3.1	a	I moved into The Flamingo the next day; and she gave up her apartment three weeks later to join me.
6043	3.4	a	It was the sort of romance that happens so rarely that most people believe it does not happen at all, the sort of romance that sustains the hopeless billions who regularly watch A Wandering Star Called Love.
6044	3.0	a	(Which is to say, you and me, Future Self.)
6045	2.37	a	Her family said she did it to support her father, who was dying of a particularly painful degenerative disease.
6046	2.75	a	Tasha said she woke up one morning convinced that if she spent another day studying vegetables, she would become one.
6047	2.3	a	She did not like my plays.
6048	2.8	a	That bothered (yes, and intrigued) me until I realized that she was bored by most plays, movies, and vid.
6049	3.0	a	I often told her that she should have a bio-check to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance.
6050	3.37	a	Even The Terran Times has only praise for his work.
6051	2.0	a	When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment.
6052	3.0	a	To compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living models.
6053	2.86	a	"He accents the illusion of reality --I paraphrase his entry in La Enciclopedia Humanica --by doing life-size scenes in ""the full round,"" never the easier frontal or three-quarters view."
6054	3.0	a	The shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that we're looking at an instant snatched from under the hooves of time.
6055	2.73	a	Yes, Self, I am also bothered that this observation ignores half-eaten cheese sandwiches, incomplete insect collections, and locks of infants' hair, forgotten in closets, basements, and warehouses.
6056	3.6	a	We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes.
6057	2.78	a	The mindwipe will take its creation from my future self --but time too often does that without aid.
6058	2.9	a	The play's second act concludes with the last fight between Tasha and me.
6059	3.0	a	I have disguised us in the play, and deleted one brief melodramatic interchange.
6060	3.22	a	I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play.
6061	3.22	a	Now I will mention it, in case I/You decide to restore it.
6062	2.75	a	"Shortly before she left, Tasha said, ""You steal from life for art, Bernardo."
6063	2.9	a	"You'll impoverish yourself."""
6064	2.75	a	Let me retreat and retrench:
6065	3.2	a	"One night during N'apulco's mild winter, Tasha returned to The Flamingo, saying, ""Nardo!"
6066	3.37	a	"""Nardo!"
6067	3.0	a	Nardo!
6068	3.1	a	"Guess what?"""
6069	3.1	a	"""You wish to become pregnant?"
6070	3.1	a	I suppose I could assist a friend.
6071	3.0	a	"Purely for the sake of the race, of course --"""
6072	3.0	a	"""Ever the altruist."
6073	2.8	a	"""What?"""
6074	3.0	a	"""Silly Nardo."""
6075	1.9	a	"""Then I give up."""
6076	3.3	a	"""Emil Malaquez is buying the house up the hill."""
6077	3.0	a	"""Oh."""
6078	3.0	a	"""Well..."""
6079	3.0	a	"""Nardo!"""
6080	3.56	a	One of the many things I liked about her was that she often thought me shockingly ignorant.
6081	3.0	a	"""That's, uh..."""
6082	2.87	a	I am never so quick-witted in person as I am on the page.
6083	2.4	a	Especially when someone thinks me shockingly ignorant.
6084	3.0	a	"""Imagine that."""
6085	2.88	a	I remembered an article in The Medusa and a photo of a work in which 100-peso notes fell like confetti onto a small Undersider, sexlessly young in grimy, oversized clothing.
6086	2.71	a	The child's face was a warground for wonder and mistrust.
6087	3.0	a	Imprisoned light from forgotten streetlamps snagged itself on metal threads in the fluttering pesos.
6088	3.0	a	The stars themselves might have fallen on the Undersider and the event would have been no less strange, no less miraculous.
6089	3.1	a	"""A great artist will grace this world, then?"""
6090	3.12	a	"""Nardo!"""
6091	2.3	a	She was never tolerant of my ego.
6092	3.1	a	"""Well."
6093	2.9	a	"What's this more-famous-than-me person like?"""
6094	2.6	a	"""I didn't meet him, jealous old one."""
6095	2.67	a	"If I thought he could free me from you --"""
6096	3.2	a	"""Hah!"""
6097	3.8	a	She wrapped her arms around my stomach.
6098	2.8	a	"""You'll never be free of me, old man!"""
6099	3.44	a	The next evening, she arrived with a stack of glistening stopboxes containing sushi, sashimi, oysters in their shells, and Terran vegetables fresh plucked from their hydroponic beds.
6100	3.0	a	Wondering about the reason for her extravagance, I asked how work had gone that day.
6101	3.0	a	"""Emil came in."
6102	2.5	a	"""You've no memory left, old one."
6103	3.0	a	"Emil Malaquez."""
6104	3.1	a	"""What?"""
6105	3.0	a	"""Calling him by his first name."
6106	3.1	a	'Nights with Karl and Groucho.'
6107	2.9	a	"It was before your time."""
6108	3.12	a	"""Oh."""
6109	3.8	a	"""The critics liked it."""
6110	4.0	a	"""I'm glad."""
6111	2.9	a	"A moment later: ""That's not why I called him 'Emil'."""
6112	2.67	a	"""That's not why I called him 'Emil'."""
6113	2.4	a	"""No?"""
6114	2.5	a	"""No."
6115	4.0	a	"He's nice."""
6116	2.88	a	"""Oh."""
6117	2.6	a	"""It wasn't like that."""
6118	3.1	a	"""Of course."
6119	2.3	a	Still, it wasn't like that.
6120	2.75	a	"You think I sleep with every famous person I meet?"""
6121	3.0	a	As you may have guessed, we had talked about such things.
6122	3.62	a	I do not claim ours was a perfect affair, only a wonderful one.
6123	3.0	a	"""Tasha --"""
6124	1.84	a	"""No."""
6125	3.37	a	"I invited him to dinner tomorrow."""
6126	2.9	a	"""Oh?"""
6127	2.5	a	"You say we're becoming too insular, that we need to socialize --"""
6128	3.18	a	"""I've socialized for sixty-three years."""
6129	3.0	a	"""Nardo?"""
6130	3.0	a	"""Yes?"""
6131	2.9	a	"""How should I reply?"""
6132	2.89	a	I had, it is true, told her that we needed other company than our own.
6133	3.12	a	I said this from years of learning that romances consume themselves without other fuel.
6134	2.6	a	But knowing this did not mean I wanted it.
6135	3.2	a	"""Truthfully."""
6136	2.5	a	It was the statement of a younger and crueler man than I.
6137	2.4	a	"She screamed, ""I haven't socialized with Terra's elite for most of my life!"
6138	2.5	a	I haven't socialized with hardly anyone for hardly any of my life!
6139	3.6	a	"And I invite a neighbor, one nice, lonely man --"""
6140	2.11	a	"""I'm sorry."""
6141	2.0	a	"""I'm sorry."
6142	3.1	a	"Truly."""
6143	3.0	a	"""Oh."""
6144	2.6	a	"She studied me as a suspicious puppy might, then said, ""I'm sorry, too."""
6145	3.0	a	"""I suppose I sound like I'm bragging when I talk of the things I'm tired of."""
6146	3.0	a	"""Only because you are."""
6147	4.0	a	She smiled.
6148	3.6	a	I had to grin, so I did.
6149	3.1	a	"""True."""
6150	3.3	a	"""He may come to dinner?"""
6151	3.1	a	"""If you wish, he may be dinner."""
6152	4.1	a	"""I love you."""
6153	3.0	a	"""And I, you."""
6154	3.1	a	Months earlier, we might have sought a bed, a couch, or a comfortable chair at this point.
6155	3.0	a	"Instead, I asked, ""Is he handsome?"""
6156	3.3	a	"""Is he handsome?"""
6157	2.22	a	"""You're jealous."""
6158	3.5	a	"Extremely."""
6159	3.1	a	"""Content yourself, old one."
6160	2.5	a	"He's four inches shorter than I, his nose is big and broken, and --"""
6161	2.9	a	But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.
6162	2.7	a	"""This is cosmetic?"""
6163	2.6	a	"""He's not that ugly."
6164	3.1	a	"I think they're his natural features."""
6165	3.22	a	"""You could write a play about someone like him."""
6166	3.0	a	"""Perhaps."""
6167	2.88	a	It's the reverse of you with those ridiculous stomach muscles.
6168	2.8	a	"Old men should be fat."""
6169	3.0	a	"""Is Emil?"""
6170	3.71	a	"""Yes."""
6171	2.25	a	"""I am jealous."
6172	3.2	a	I'll eat two dinners tonight.
6173	3.0	a	"Five deserts."""
6174	3.9	a	She giggled.
6175	4.0	a	And then we did make love.
6176	2.9	a	I've been thinking about the mindwipe, now two days away.
6177	3.0	a	Who said that those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it?
6178	3.09	a	Add this to the reasons I write now: to remember something, perhaps even to learn --
6179	3.0	a	This work is hereby released into the Public Domain.
6180	3.0	a	Emil Malaquez arrived after sundown, carrying a small package wrapped in what looked like real paper.
6181	3.0	a	His evening dress was formal, expensive, and slightly stained, as that of all forgetful artists should be.
6182	3.11	a	He was a jovial man with an easy laugh, and even uglier than Tasha had suggested.
6183	3.9	a	I liked him immediately.
6184	3.11	a	"""Señor Malaquez?"""
6185	3.0	a	"""Please."
6186	3.0	a	You must be Bernardo.
6187	3.25	a	"Tasha's told me much about you."""
6188	2.75	a	Let me begin again.
6189	3.1	a	"""All of it outrageous praise?"""
6190	3.2	a	"""All of it."""
6191	3.8	a	"""Ah, she is wonderfully perceptive."""
6192	3.43	a	He raised an eyebrow, then guffawed.
6193	2.71	a	"""Has she said as much about me?"""
6194	3.8	a	"Stepping into the living room, he said, ""A beautiful house."""
6195	3.56	a	"""A beautiful house."""
6196	3.7	a	"""I'm glad you came after dark."""
6197	3.4	a	"""Emil!"""
6198	3.0	a	She leapt up.
6199	2.45	a	"""I did not expect you --"""
6200	2.64	a	"""So early?"""
6201	3.2	a	""" --on time."
6202	2.8	a	"It's unforgiveable, but you're forgiven."""
6203	3.2	a	She nodded at the package.
6204	2.9	a	"""What's that?"""
6205	3.43	a	"""For your kindness in inviting a stranger into your home."""
6206	3.33	a	"""Oh!"""
6207	2.9	a	I stopped writing, and only the thought that I might miss the mindwipe kept me from another spree.
6208	2.82	a	I went walking, but after N'apulco, Rio seems no fit abode for a creature of flesh.
6209	3.0	a	I walked from this hotel to the old city, past the end of the slidewalks and softwalks to the hard, cracked pavement of City Park.
6210	2.75	a	But Undersiders left me alone.
6211	3.0	a	The side of Malaquez's parcel gave way to reveal a greenmunk caught in a sheen of solid air.
6212	3.0	a	Bits of leaf mold flew from under his feet as he ran to greet a friend or a bringer of food.
6213	3.6	a	Last year, I rented a small house on Vega IV, a sea world, all islands and reefs and archipelagos, turquoise waters and aquamarine skies, sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova.
6214	3.5	a	Tasha oohed in awe.
6215	3.1	a	"""Frodo's been visiting you, eh?"""
6216	3.2	a	"""Your pet?"""
6217	2.9	a	He lives around here somewhere.
6218	3.12	a	"""Ah,"""
6219	3.25	a	"Tasha said, ""A little fellow with big, furry feet."
6220	3.1	a	"""A little fellow with big, furry feet."
6221	3.0	a	She handed the sculpture to me.
6222	2.8	a	I almost dropped it; I expected it to weigh no more than a holo.
6223	2.7	a	"""Heavy,"""
6224	3.0	a	"""My last piece was of four old Undersiders crouched around a trash fire."
6225	3.29	a	"Be glad someone didn't toss that to you."""
6226	3.8	a	He spoke of his art with the enthusiasm of a seven-year-old.
6227	3.0	a	"""Um, I should wait to importune you, but..."""
6228	2.9	a	"""A confession, and then a request."
6229	2.83	a	"It's not easy for me to ask a favor."""
6230	3.6	a	"""Relax,"""
6231	2.9	a	"""Relax,"" I said."
6232	3.2	a	"""It's easy for me to turn one down."""
6233	3.1	a	He glanced at me and decided I was joking.
6234	3.0	a	The surprising thing is that I was.
6235	4.2	a	"""Good."
6236	2.7	a	"My last show --"""
6237	3.0	a	Tasha said.
6238	3.5	a	""" --was kindly received,"""
6239	3.3	a	""" --was kindly received,"" he said."
6240	2.9	a	"""But an artist who would stay first among his fellows can tell when he begins to fail."""
6241	3.0	a	"""Oh?"""
6242	2.9	a	I hoped no one would bring up my last three plays.
6243	2.73	a	"""I must change my subject matter."
6244	2.8	a	No more urchins, dopers, vagrants, or whores.
6245	3.0	a	"I want to do more traditional portraits."""
6246	2.25	a	He spoke quickly, prepared to be rejected.
6247	3.1	a	"""Would you permit me to do one of you?"
6248	3.0	a	"""Ah."""
6249	3.0	a	"""Nardo!"""
6250	3.0	a	Tasha said.
6251	4.0	a	"""It's an honor --"""
6252	3.3	a	"""Of course,"""
6253	3.11	a	"""Of course,"" I said."
6254	2.86	a	"""That's why I cannot take payment."""
6255	3.0	a	"""Oh?"
6256	3.29	a	Oh!
6257	3.12	a	"""And you as well?"
6258	3.0	a	"Perhaps the two of you together?"""
6259	3.14	a	There's only one city: called Nuevo Acapulco in La Enciclopedia del Empirio de la Humanidad, it's N'apulco to the locals.
6260	3.0	a	"""Oh..."""
6261	4.3	a	"""My God, yes, yes, yes!"""
6262	4.38	a	For a perfect moment, Emil and Tasha and I were one entity, laughing until our lungs hurt.
6263	2.14	a	I had not considered that I might not write to learn, but to punish myself.
6264	3.2	a	Then we went out for a late swim.
6265	2.8	a	I had drunk too much, I confess, though we all had.
6266	2.7	a	Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine.
6267	3.1	a	She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert.
6268	3.1	a	The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made.
6269	2.8	a	She had no choice but to follow.
6270	3.22	a	The N'apulcans are mostly emigrants from Polaris II; the only difference between them and their Carribbean ancestors is that the ancestors fleeced NorAm tourists.
6271	3.1	a	"Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of ""Captured Moments."""
6272	3.12	a	) I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments.
6273	2.4	a	Malaquez glanced away, embarrassed.
6274	3.4	a	"Tasha looked at me as if to say, ""I will."""
6275	3.33	a	"""I will."""
6276	2.6	a	"She said, ""I feel sorry for you, Nardo."
6277	2.38	a	"""I feel sorry for you, Nardo."
6278	3.0	a	"I'll see Emil home."""
6279	3.4	a	"""Yes,"""
6280	3.0	a	"""Yes,"" I said, ""Do that,"" and did not care what she did, or why."
6281	3.12	a	"""Do that,"""
6282	2.91	a	"""You're all right?"""
6283	3.0	a	I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent.
6284	2.14	a	Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself, I finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping Flamingo to drink myself to sleep.
6285	2.1	a	She had not come home when I woke in mid-morning.
6286	2.5	a	I waited, and drank a glass of MorningAfter and three cups of coffee, and wondered whether our affair could survive the events of the night, and whether I wanted it to.
6287	2.7	a	Perhaps I should have invited Emil to stay, but even then I knew that sex was not the problem between Tasha and me.
6288	2.75	a	The problem was that I have trouble distinguishing between compromise and capitulation, between symbols and substance.
6289	2.6	a	Shortly before noon, I climbed the sandy path to Dream's End, rehearsing my apology, slowing only to pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet.
6290	2.9	a	Malaquez answered the door in blood-red pajamas and a black silk robe.
6291	2.5	a	Sixty years ago in a similar situation, I had broken my knuckles on someone's face.
6292	2.8	a	"I merely said, ""Is Tasha here?"""
6293	2.9	a	"""Is Tasha here?"""
6294	2.9	a	Now the N'apulcans profit from their Hispanic siblings.
6295	3.0	a	He pursed his lips slightly, then nodded.
6296	3.29	a	"""Yes."""
6297	3.0	a	"""May I see her?"""
6298	2.5	a	"When he hesitated, I said, ""Last night was my fault."
6299	2.2	a	"""Last night was my fault."
6300	3.0	a	I hold it against neither of you.
6301	3.0	a	"Let me talk to her."""
6302	3.1	a	"""Please."""
6303	3.33	a	"He looked me and at last said, ""Very well."""
6304	3.5	a	"""Very well."""
6305	2.9	a	We walked through his house in silence.
6306	2.8	a	If that was Malaquez's work, it was a very minor effort.
6307	2.14	a	I only wanted to despise the man who had slept with my lover.
6308	2.88	a	That was easier than despising myself.
6309	3.0	a	"""I should go in first."
6310	3.9	a	I smiled.
6311	2.8	a	"""What would it hurt?"""
6312	3.33	a	"""True."
6313	3.14	a	Go ahead.
6314	2.8	a	I shrugged.
6315	4.4	a	"""Tell her I love her."""
6316	2.7	a	"He studied me, then said, ""I'm sorry things happened this way, Bernardo."
6317	2.12	a	"""I'm sorry things happened this way, Bernardo."
6318	3.1	a	"I didn't anticipate last night --"""
6319	3.38	a	"""I'm very good at making things happen this way."
6320	2.25	a	"He nodded, repeated, ""I am sorry,"" then slipped into the next room."
6321	2.3	a	"""I am sorry,"""
6322	2.7	a	I waited in the dark, carpeted hall.
6323	2.9	a	"I heard no voices until Malaquez said, ""Enter."""
6324	3.1	a	"""Enter."""
6325	3.0	a	I blinked when I opened the door.
6326	3.37	a	Sunlight filled Malaquez's bedroom.
6327	2.9	a	Tasha lay sprawled nude on a rumpled bed.
6328	3.63	a	She was looking slightly to my left, smiling with trust and satisfaction like one sexually content.
6329	3.0	a	Malaquez stood near her, pointing something at my chest.
6330	3.5	a	Though the morning sun shone fully on both of them, it shimmered around Tasha.
6331	2.56	a	The part of my mind that remembered four months in NorAm during the Great Cleaning sent me rolling across the floor.
6332	3.0	a	Malaquez was not prepared for me to react so quickly, or perhaps he waited too long for an expression I would not have, a gesture I would not make, a poignant moment of repentence, wonder, despair, or love.
6333	3.0	a	The following events may indicate otherwise.
6334	2.8	a	Had he been faster, he could have had rage.
6335	1.8	a	I threw a chair at him.
6336	2.44	a	As he fell, I scrambled onto him, my knees pinning his arms, my fingers probing his neck.
6337	2.82	a	"I shouted, ""Where is she?"
6338	2.4	a	"Tell me, or I'll kill --"""
6339	1.9	a	He began to cry.
6340	2.8	a	"""She left."
6341	3.0	a	"Earlier this morning --"""
6342	2.9	a	Her clothes lay by the cube enclosing the bed.
6343	3.09	a	"""Tell me, Malaquez."""
6344	2.9	a	"""She wanted to be famous."
6345	3.3	a	She did!
6346	2.9	a	"Now she will be."""
6347	2.86	a	He seemed to expect me to understand.
6348	2.44	a	Most of his story I have pieced together since, but I understood enough as I knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy throat.
6349	3.0	a	He had made his name with a home capturador.
6350	3.0	a	He began with small animals and moved on to derelicts and Undersiders, people who would never be missed.
6351	3.0	a	Now he had thought to use vacationers like Tasha and me, and when someone came looking, he would say we had gone island-hopping in our windboat.
6352	3.0	a	Mine was The Sleeping Flamingo, and its outer walls were coral pink.
6353	3.0	a	His story would stand in either case.
6354	2.8	a	I wanted him to tell me more, but he babbled, begging me to forgive him, to understand.
6355	2.33	a	I did not listen.
6356	2.88	a	I think I was wondering what it meant to say that a thing was art, so we accepted it as art.
6357	2.9	a	Or perhaps I was thinking about the things that humanity made that would outlive our species.
6358	2.86	a	Had he said then that I should use it on myself, I might have.
6359	2.56	a	That moment passed.
6360	3.1	a	I looked at Malaquez.
6361	3.1	a	Were they mood-sensitive, they would have changed as I first viewed them.
6362	2.8	a	His lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound.
6363	2.4	a	I turned to touch the cube that was Tasha's crypt.
6364	3.44	a	She smiled in trust or pleasure or pride, an erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever, and I could never know why.
6365	3.1	a	I could free Tasha.
6366	3.1	a	If I did, one of three things would happen.
6367	2.9	a	Most likely: she would be meat --there is a reason why stopboxes are most often used in kitchens.
6368	3.12	a	Less likely: she would live the rest of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slug's.
6369	3.0	a	And the tiniest chance of all: she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emil's bedroom, and then she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal.
6370	2.8	a	The rental agent, an attractive N'apulcan named Tasha Cortez, was not mood-sensitive either.
6371	3.1	a	It is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we should hate.
6372	3.4	a	"Know this, my future self: Thanks to us, Emil Malaquez's name will live as long as his masterpiece, ""A Self-Portrait: Anguish,"" endures."
6373	3.2	a	"I could say that I chose out of consideration for her desire for fame; some critics already say ""Waking With Tasha"" is Malaquez's finest work."
6374	3.17	a	If science finds a way to safely free the subjects of Emil's art, perhaps the I who reads this file will know that my decision is wise.
6375	2.2	a	But I cannot stop thinking that I was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death.
6376	2.6	a	My fear is that she would live, and I would learn that I had lost her long before Emil Malaquez translated her into a thing that can be kept, admired, and loved.
6377	3.0	a	For in my way, I have done the same thing.
6378	3.6	a	"She said, ""It's beautiful, isn't it, Señor Flynn?"""
6379	2.89	a	I am ready for the mindwipe now.
6380	3.5	a	"""It's beautiful, isn't it, Señor Flynn?"""
6381	2.8	a	But she was young and attractive (as I have said and may say again) and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism.
6382	2.78	a	"And then, because a playwright cannot resist a promising line, I said, ""Your Sleeping Flamingo should be put to sleep."""
6383	2.44	a	"""Your Sleeping Flamingo should be put to sleep."""
6384	2.9	a	To say her face fell would do a disservice to Tasha and to literature.
6385	2.88	a	(Allow me my self-indulgences as you would those of a dying man -- when I convince my mindsmith to permit the wipe, there will be another Bernardo Flynn, one who knows no more of Tasha Cortez or Vega IV than he reads here.)
6386	3.0	a	Her brows drew together, creasing the lovely, caramel-colored skin around her eyes and showing the pattern for an old woman's wrinkles on her forehead.
6387	3.29	a	Her lower lip (a trifle too narrow for her face, perhaps her only physical flaw) thrust forward slightly as she started to speak.
6388	2.7	a	"""You don't like it?"""
6389	4.1	a	I laughed.
6390	2.62	a	What could I do?
6391	3.1	a	I clapped her shoulder to show I was not laughing at her.
6392	3.33	a	"""Like it?"
6393	1.3	a	I hate it, despise it, abhor it!
6394	2.5	a	It's gaudy, graceless, pretentious -- That house is an affront to taste and intelligence.
6395	2.5	a	I should buy it to raze it, but I am not so kind-hearted.
6396	3.0	a	"I might, however, rent it."""
6397	3.4	a	Captured Moments
6398	2.7	a	I think she only heard the last words of my speech.
6399	3.11	a	"""You will?"""
6400	3.8	a	"""It amuses me."
6401	3.12	a	"""Of course, Señor Flynn."""
6402	2.43	a	"""And stop calling me 'señor'."
6403	2.9	a	Not even Los Mundos is so polite.
6404	3.25	a	"Call me Bernardo."""
6405	3.18	a	"""If you wish."""
6406	2.67	a	"""I beg you, change the color of the walls, at the very least."""
6407	3.57	a	"""But of course!"""
6408	3.0	a	I stared.
6409	3.0	a	"""How's that?"""
6410	3.0	a	I looked at her.
6411	3.22	a	I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday.
6412	3.0	a	I nodded.
6413	3.11	a	"""I would not have thought it possible."""
6414	2.43	a	She frowned.
6415	2.29	a	"""Thoroughly ugly,"""
6416	3.0	a	"""Thoroughly ugly,"" I corrected with smile."
6417	3.87	a	"""Obscenely ugly,"" said she, smiling too."
6418	2.9	a	"""No."""
6419	3.0	a	I pointed.
6420	2.82	a	"""It has no tower."""
6421	3.0	a	She reached for another dial on the house controls.
6422	2.5	a	"""Don't you dare!"""
6423	3.4	a	Her wrist, when I grabbed it, was smooth and strong and warm in my fingers.
6424	3.75	a	"""I'll take it."
6425	3.0	a	"Exactly as it is."""
6426	3.22	a	"""You will?"""
6427	2.8	a	"God knows what you might do to it next."""
6428	2.4	a	Reluctantly, I released her hand.
6429	3.5	a	The interior of The Flamingo was a welcome surprise.
6430	3.14	a	Cloudwood had been used in a Mediterranean manner, making the house seem primitive and civilized at the same time.
6431	3.5	a	The kitchen and baths had every convenience that I desired.
6432	3.0	a	From the living room, the view of the beach struck me with such intensity that Tasha asked if I felt ill.
6433	2.5	a	"All I could say was, ""No."
6434	2.5	a	It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it.
6435	3.1	a	We both thought I referred to the vista.
6436	2.6	a	It's strange how one can write delightedly of the happier moments of life, forgetting the things that one would forget by remembering fully the things one would remember, and suddenly the forgotten, in revenge, rears up to savage the unwary.
6437	2.9	a	So it was as I wrote the preceding.
6438	3.0	a	My heart convulsed, and I left this manuscript for a three-day spree.
6439	3.29	a	Apparently I was so successful that it lasted a week and a half.
6440	3.25	a	Not bad for an eighty-three-year-old, even for one who has his rejuve every month.
6441	2.7	a	And if I can brag and digress so easily, this must not be painful enough to merit a mindwipe, yes?
6442	2.78	a	I abandoned these notes to my future self to have the wipe done immediately, thinking that Bernardo Flynn should receive such services when he needed them, even should the need arise at the third hour after midnight.
6443	2.5	a	My mindsmith is not so understanding.
6444	3.2	a	Captured Moments
6445	3.0	a	"She says I am emotionally a child, to which I reply, ""Of course."
6446	2.75	a	"Why else would I come to you?"""
6447	2.6	a	This logic does not soothe her; she says I must wait three weeks.
6448	3.29	a	Three!
6449	3.0	a	.
6450	3.0	a	Such is the law.
6451	2.8	a	I say I do not care about law, I care about service and she should care about money.
6452	2.3	a	Enough.
6453	3.67	a	I went on a spree, and it must have been a good one.
6454	3.33	a	I hope the wipe is as successful with my time on Vega IV as my spree was with my time here.
6455	2.73	a	I dimly remember three bedpartners who were probably human, and one that I hope was delirium.
6456	2.63	a	I will not answer the phone for a week, no matter whose face appears on it.
6457	2.6	a	I keep evading the issue.
6458	2.9	a	But which issue?
6459	2.7	a	The issue of why I am evading the issue, or the issue itself?
6460	3.56	a	If I am capable of love, I loved Tasha Cortez.
6461	3.5	a	The playwright in me wants every scene of our time together.
6462	3.0	a	“can’t-miss”
6463	3.2	a	Wolves can run fast — but they certainly can’t outrun airplanes.
6464	2.7	a	Given the urgency of the situation in Alaska, Defenders needs your immediate assistance to help save Alaska’s wolves from same-day airborne land-and-shoot slaughter.
6465	3.0	a	Support the Emergency Effort to Save Alaska’s Wolves.
6466	3.0	a	Soon this wolf won’t be merely running in the snow.
6467	3.0	a	Defenders hopes to raise at least $100,000 to help Alaskans For Wildlife, a coalition of Alaska citizens, win a citizens’ ballot initiative this November.
6468	2.6	a	And we face very wealthy opponents.
6469	2.8	a	So today, I urge you to do these two things: FIRST: Sign the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to show our Alaska allies your strong personal support to reinstate the ban on “same-day airborne land-and-shoot” wolf killing in Alaska; SECOND: Rush an urgent donation to help put this measure on the ballot and win passage in November.
6470	3.0	a	“same-day airborne land-and-shoot”
6471	2.5	a	The Alaska Legislature is completely out of step with the will of Alaska’s citizens and the American public at large.
6472	3.0	a	This wolf will be running for its life!
6473	3.0	a	Like you, the majority of Alaskans oppose same-day land-and-shoot wolf killing.
6474	2.29	a	But the anti-wolf politicians in the Alaska legislature don’t care what the majority of Alaska citizens want.
6475	2.6	a	And they didn’t listen to the recommendations of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, which opposed this legislation!
6476	2.3	a	They are utterly out of step with their Alaska constituents ... the state agency that manages Alaska wildlife ... and the rest of the American public!
6477	2.89	a	The airplane above will be tracking her ... in order to land and immediately gun her down .
6478	2.14	a	In the name of “wolf control,” wolf killers will predictably once again use aircraft to hunt wolves to the point of exhaustion, so that the wolves have, literally, no chance of survival.
6479	2.6	a	And if history is any guide, over the years thousands of Alaska’s wolves will be brutally killed.
6480	2.4	a	Before the 1996 ban on same-day land-and-shoot, as many as 400 wolves were killed in Alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice.
6481	2.9	a	Anti-wolf interests are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure that the new land-and-shoot law stands — even though most Alaskans do not support it.
6482	3.18	a	“Last Frontier.”
6483	3.0	a	The only way Alaskans can repeal the new law and reinstate the ban on same-day airborne land-and-shoot wolf killing is with a Citizens’ Referendum.
6484	2.6	a	You see, the Alaska legislature passed a law that once again allows any private citizen with just a $15 trapping or $25 hunting license to track wolves by aircraft and then land and gun them down.
6485	3.0	a	Alaska wolf advocates need your immediate support to save wolves.
6486	2.78	a	To repeal this unconscionable law, Defenders must help provide our friends in Alaska -- Alaskans For Wildlife — with the resources necessary to win at the polls in November.
6487	2.3	a	Our well-funded opponents will spend whatever it takes to mislead and confuse voters about this ballot measure.
6488	2.63	a	If Alaska’s new law is not replaced, thousands of Alaska's wolves will die in the years to come.
6489	2.46	a	And it will be a major setback for wolves nationwide — at a time when the American public overwhelmingly favors wolf reintroduction and protection.
6490	2.6	a	A loss will encourage those anti-wolf fanatics who want to stop wolf restoration and put bounties on those wolves already in the wild.
6491	2.89	a	So, please don’t wait another minute.
6492	3.0	a	Please sign your Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to demonstrate to our Alaska allies that you’re behind them; and send an urgent donation today to help them win this effort.
6493	3.0	a	So how will your money be spent?
6494	3.0	a	$45,000 — salaries /office expenses for staff to oversee the effort between now and election day.
6495	3.0	a	$30,000 — production of television and radio spots alerting the public to the findings of the above survey.
6496	2.22	a	This cruel, unethical wolf-hunting practice is called “same-day airborne land-and-shoot.”
6497	3.0	a	$100,000 — placement of voter education spots in the key media including print, radio and television.
6498	3.17	a	Now, I’m hoping I can count on your moral and financial support again today.
6499	3.0	a	“same-day airborne land-and-shoot.”
6500	2.5	a	to help save Alaska’s wolves from same-day airborne land-and-shoot killing.
6501	2.9	a	Your special donation today is absolutely critical, because many of Alaska’s politicians clearly have anti-wolf agendas.
6502	2.9	a	They have the financial backing of powerful special interests and the determination to ignore the will of the people of Alaska and the American public.
6503	3.0	a	Please let Alaskans know that you’re behind them.
6504	3.22	a	It was a total shock and surprise.
6505	3.1	a	Please help save Alaska’s wolves by doing these two things:
6506	2.78	a	1. SIGN the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to show your support for repealing “same-day airborne land-and-shoot” wolf killing in Alaska;
6507	3.2	a	2. RUSH a special donation to help our Alaska allies overturn this odious new law.
6508	3.0	a	Remember, for this emergency effort to succeed, we must act immediately.
6509	2.9	a	In May the Alaska legislature voted to reinstate same-day airborne wolf killing.
6510	3.0	a	And then, mail it back to us along with your emergency donation to help save Alaska’s wolves.
6511	3.5	a	Thank you for your strong support.
6512	3.0	a	P.S.: Defenders needs your help to raise $100,000 in emergency funds to help ensure that the coalition’s Emergency Effort to Save Alaska’s Wolves succeeds.
6513	3.14	a	So, please sign the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to lend your moral support to our Alaska friends and return it in the enclosed envelope with a special donation.
6514	3.0	a	Look closely at this photo, and you’ll see a wolf ... running.
6515	2.6	a	But they did, overriding Governor Tony Knowles’ veto — and ignoring the will of the majority of Alaska’s citizens.
6516	2.71	a	Unfortunately, this practice will begin after the first snow ... this September ... when wolves will be “can’t-miss” targets against Alaska’s snowy terrain.
6517	3.09	a	"Someone will need to begin by creating an urban ""oasis"" that mitigates some of the fears that you had while driving through the city -- where to buy groceries, a place where you can feel safe on your own front porch, the freedom to sleep soundly without worrying about your copper wiring."
6518	3.2	a	3. For all that is wrong with Detroit -- and that's nearly everything -- you'd be astonished by the pride that Detroiters have for their city.
6519	2.6	a	They lack the means to build her back to her former glory, but she won't be abandoned.
6520	3.0	a	For all of those who are trapped there by their circumstances, there are just as many who insist that they wouldn't live anywhere else.
6521	2.7	a	Raggedy Anarchy 21. Sep, 2009 at 7:21 pm
6522	3.6	a	Thank you for the opportunity to see post-BushCo era Detroit through the prism of your vision.
6523	2.5	a	I've never been there, but ever since that mad, possessed American History Professor I had, I've been haunted by Detroit.
6524	3.0	a	No, even before that -- The Dollmaker has often been called 'America's least pretentious masterpiece'.
6525	2.7	a	Why, out in New Mexico, where you can still buy unincorporated land with no water or roads, you'd pay at least $1,000 for a house-sized plot of dust.
6526	3.1	a	(Joyce Carol Oates in the NYTBR) When folks like Gertie Nevels, and Levon Helm and John Hiatt and my favorite, John Henry, left the mountains to go wrestle with the Industrial leviathan in Detroit, they were in it to the death.
6527	3.1	a	Detroit won't be the death of the courage of those early Detroit pioneers; it looks like Nature will prevail after all.
6528	4.3	a	I love what you are doing.

6619	2.7	a	I, too checked out a few listings for under $1,000 and was absolutely shocked at the property taxes.
6620	2.45	a	Additionally, even if you paid cash for the house, you'd probably want to carry some homeowner's insurance with all the inherent risks to the property (arson, vandalism), and I'm sure it's sky-high, given those risks.
6621	3.2	a	And so Quiet Earp and I did some research, and came up with a list of houses selling for under a grand.
6622	3.7	a	We had plenty to choose from: there were more cheap houses than we would have time to visit.
6623	3.3	a	We picked two neighborhoods to cruise, and dove in.
6624	2.7	a	But once we entered Detroit, the truth hit fast: this is a modern American ghost town.
6625	2.6	a	The place is practically deserted.
6626	2.9	a	Its streets, built wide to accommodate heavy traffic, are mostly empty.
6627	2.7	a	Don't believe me?
6628	3.0	a	I videotaped it:
6629	2.0	a	It got worse as we drove into residential areas, looking for those cheap houses.
6630	2.0	a	In fact, I've never felt so out of place in all my life .
6631	2.6	a	Even in Chicago's South Side, where we counted five white people in an hour, I felt fine just driving around; not so in Detroit.
6632	2.9	a	Truthfully, it wasn't about race: it was about being naive.
6633	2.4	a	It was about driving down streets where we truly did not belong and were not welcome.
6634	2.4	a	Detroit is a ghost town, and it's inhabited by ghosts: the only people left here are those who can't or won't leave.
6635	2.3	a	They sit on the porch and watch the cars go by, watch the deals go down, watch their neighborhoods crumble.
6636	2.91	a	So we sped up, and went straight to the houses.
6637	2.9	a	Sometimes we stopped to take a photo, but mostly we didn't.
6638	2.4	a	Earp and I have each lived happily in the wilds of West Oakland, but the danger I felt in Detroit was like nothing I'd experienced before.
6639	1.7	a	I was actually afraid for my life.
6640	2.8	a	"The New York Times correspondent wrote that his friend Mitch's $1,900 home ""had already been stripped of its appliances and wiring ..."
6641	3.6	a	But for Mitch that only added to its appeal, because he now had the opportunity to renovate it with solar heating, solar electricity and low-cost, high-efficiency appliances.
6642	3.0	a	As for the $100 house?
6643	2.7	a	"It ""needed some work, a hole patched, some windows replaced."""
6644	3.0	a	"""needed some work, a hole patched, some windows replaced."""
6645	2.9	a	Well, I don't know what part of Detroit these folks live in, but the $100 houses I saw looked more like this:
6646	2.64	a	No exceptions.
6647	2.4	a	Wherever we went in those neighborhoods, one in four houses had been torched.
6648	2.1	a	We didn't slow down to take a photo, but I'll paraphrase: DON'T BURN HOUSES DOWN!
6649	2.7	a	Except that they obviously aren't.
6650	2.7	a	And although I and many others would love to own even a fire-scarred, condemned building, the fact is that we wouldn't last a week here.
6651	2.7	a	Buy a $100 house in Detroit, and you get a lifetime supply of sleepless nights: you'll spend the next several years waiting for burglars and arsonists, murderers and crackheads to break in the windows.
6652	2.7	a	It's like the Wild West without the scenery, the gold, and the hope.
6653	3.0	a	It's the Rust Belt.
6654	3.1	a	Ultimately, I do believe that change will come to Detroit.
6655	3.3	a	There will be a green movement here ; in fact it's already being cultivated by forward-thinking groups and intrepid locals .
6656	3.3	a	One day, this place will be reborn.
6657	2.6	a	But right now, the NYT's story reeks of Shinola.
6658	2.9	a	Truth is, any artist-type who moves into this part of Detroit is probably pretty handy with a pistol or a shotgun .
6659	2.8	a	Anyone who takes this plunge is risking their life every day, betting on a future that may take a long time to arrive.
6660	3.3	a	Long story short: Yes, you can buy a house in Detroit for $100.
6661	2.8	a	Cheap real estate, that's what.
6662	4.0	a	Cheers to Toby Barlow , who inspired my trek to Detroit, and who believes in a happier, greener future.

6671	2.9	a	"""Detroit: A City to Yourself"""
6672	2.9	a	It's full of this imagery, and talks about the 1805 fire and rebuilding, and the post-industrial devastation that's ravaged the city since.
6673	3.2	a	The movie wraps up by observing this, how abandoned buildings and spaces are being reclaimed by nature.
6674	3.1	a	About the pop fiction which explores the concept of a post-human world, and how it already exists now.
6675	2.8	a	HOWEVER ...
6676	3.0	a	There's a lot more to Detroit than that.
6677	3.1	a	There are industrial spaces being turned into low-rent artist lofts and business incubators.
6678	3.0	a	(Look at the Russell Industrial Complex, for one example.)
6679	3.18	a	There are neighborhoods that refuse to cave.
6680	3.0	a	(west of Livernois around McNichols).
6681	3.6	a	There's a whole bunch of nice stuff happening along the riverfront, from downtown up towards Stroh Place.
6682	3.2	a	And there's always Belle Isle.
6683	2.7	a	Some of us (and lots of New Yorkers) pay that much in rent every month!
6684	3.3	a	It's our in-the-river park, 982 acres of green space, with a zoo, a botanical garden and conservatory, rentable paddle boats, and tons of other neat stuff.
6685	3.4	a	Next time you're in Detroit, please head over.
6686	3.4	a	Oh, and entry is free, so it's available to anyone regardless of economic status.
6687	3.2	a	You're liable to see families picnicking, bums gathering bottles and cans, geese foraging, and deer cautiously wandering the edge of the woods.
6688	3.0	a	Within a hundred yards of each other.
6689	3.2	a	Some of that cheap real estate isn't too horrible, either.
6690	3.8	a	Some of the things they've done down there are amazing, and the community garden is a great bridge to the surrounding neighborhood.
6691	3.1	a	In fact, the article went on, soon a nearby house went on the market for $100.
6692	2.7	a	America's Rust Belt is a swath of cities and towns that boomed during the Industrial Era and now lie -- well, rusting -- as empty remainders of glory days past.
6693	2.9	a	Whoever took that stuff is probably using it in their own garden.
6694	2.8	a	Yes, Detroit's got more than its share of bad spots, you're right.
6695	2.4	a	I've lived in the metro area my whole life, and there are areas (I can't call them neighborhoods) down there where I don't feel safe in daytime, much less at night.
6696	3.4	a	But there are bright spots, and behind every one of them is a person, or a bunch of people, who refuse to give up.

6702	3.0	a	Reader Not Writer 20. Sep, 2009 at 10:17 pm
6703	3.0	a	Well, growing up not far from Detroit myself, I would point out a few things:
6704	3.3	a	I was intrigued.
6705	2.67	a	1. Driving a Honda in Detroit right now probably isn't really going to get you welcomed with open arms.
6706	2.7	a	"See, there's a wee bit of loyalty to the Big 3 and driving a foreign car doesn't really scream ""solidarity"" to those struggling to survive."
6707	2.9	a	Really?
6708	3.09	a	Most of the funny looks you got were less about your color than about your ride.
6709	2.3	a	You think I'm kidding, but I couldn't be more serious -- that Honda is a visceral reminder for people of how the American consumer has left Detroit in the dust.
6710	3.4	a	Even if it was a real fixer-upper, even if you really were better off tearing it down than living in it, that'd still be a hell of a deal.
6711	2.6	a	2. Detroit (proper) has been dying for a long time -- before the 1968 riots, even.
6712	3.0	a	Its going to take some pioneering individuals to start creating those pockets of innovation, creativity, and vision.
6713	2.5	a	But its not going to happen with the investment of $100 into a single house.
6714	2.9	a	The next moment, Acres was there.
6715	2.7	a	Hands up in the same way mine were frozen.
6716	3.0	a	We just looked at each other.
6717	2.6	a	I guess, thinking back, I might have expected him to gloat, but the view was the kind of thing that humbles you, shuts your mouth.
6718	3.0	a	We just stood looking at each other for a little while, I don't know how long.
6719	3.0	a	What is it?
6720	2.9	a	"he wasn't the sort you'd call ""Chuck."""
6721	3.0	a	A place.
6722	2.89	a	I don't know.
6723	2.9	a	"I think this whole thing,"" he waved his hand at the horizon, ""is one big machine."
6724	3.0	a	And the markers were carved later, not be whoever built it.
6725	3.29	a	The markers are places where it's safe to come here and leave.
6726	3.1	a	Safe?
6727	3.0	a	I looked around.
6728	2.2	a	One thing this place didn't seem was safe.
6729	3.0	a	Let me show you the rest.
6730	3.0	a	He started walking down the steps and around a corner.
6731	2.67	a	It would have taken plenty to surprise me after what I had already seen, but My jaw was banging against my shoelaces when I rounded that corner.
6732	3.0	a	'm a linguistics researcher, Ed.
6733	3.0	a	I'm not sure how something so big could have been hidden by that little turn in landscape, but maybe perspective doesn't work quite the same there.
6734	3.3	a	He took a sip and closed his eyes like the cheap cup of coffee was really something special.
6735	2.1	a	For some reason I thought of a giant clown face from a carnival ride, but it scared the hell out me.
6736	3.0	a	Acres stood beside it and somehow using him as a yardstick for the scale of the thing made it easier to see.
6737	3.2	a	This is what I wanted to show you.
6738	3.1	a	I looked down and saw he was pointing to another marker just slightly different from the one we had just left.
6739	2.75	a	I was pretty rattled, but things fell together for me looking at the big statue, the Hawaiian shirt and the mark on the ground.
6740	3.1	a	Easter Island?
6741	3.2	a	Acres nodded.
6742	2.88	a	It was all too much for me so I focused on the part I could handle.
6743	2.9	a	So what does this have to do with gold?
6744	3.0	a	You would end up on a small hill on Rapa Nui.
6745	2.7	a	You could step three feet to the right and do the same thing, and you would end up buried alive in a nearby rock face.
6746	3.3	a	But I know how to make it take me anywhere.
6747	3.1	a	He pulled a sheet of folded paper from his pocket and handed it to me.
6748	3.11	a	"It read, ""Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service, Status Report of U.S. Treasury-Owned Gold."""
6749	2.9	a	"He pointed to a row that read, ""Deep Storage: Fort Knox, KY."""
6750	2.75	a	I sucked in a whole lot of air.
6751	3.17	a	Anywhere?
6752	3.2	a	"Anywhere,"" he walked around the moai and came back wrestling with a big, heavy bar of gold."
6753	3.1	a	Otherwise the vault is sealed.
6754	3.1	a	He set the cup down and looked straight at me for the first time.
6755	3.1	a	Does anyone else know about this?
6756	2.91	a	No, they would have been on Rapa Nui if they knew, ready to stop me.
6757	3.0	a	This is the 400 ounces which I mentioned at the restaurant.
6758	2.91	a	About $150,000 dollars at this morning's rate.
6759	3.0	a	I hadn't seen him since high-school, maybe twenty years before, and we were never buddies in the first place.
6760	3.0	a	I looked at the sheet in my hand.
6761	2.89	a	Deep Storage: Fort Knox, Ky.
6762	3.0	a	I had to read it twice.
6763	3.0	a	I had never seen a dollar sign in front of that many number before.
6764	3.36	a	The gold is still there.
6765	2.8	a	Charles put the bar down and slid a web pouch over it with shoulder straps like a small backpack.
6766	2.86	a	How's your um... business?
6767	2.78	a	None
6768	3.0	a	"Call me small minded, but you know ""a bird in the hand."""
6769	2.71	a	All that gold in Fort Knox was just too much for me to wrap my head around.
6770	3.1	a	But I could handle a hundred and fifty-K easy, say seventy-five-K from the fence.
6771	2.8	a	Fine.
6772	2.89	a	I slipped the little pouch over my back and wiped the knife on his jacket.
6773	3.0	a	I waived down a waitress and ordered a cup of decaf and a slice of pie.
6774	3.0	a	Then I made my way back to the little marker where we came in.
6775	2.5	a	I worried for just a moment when I started waving my hands.
6776	2.78	a	What if it didn't work?
6777	3.37	a	So the icy wind at the top of the mound and the bright moon came as a real relief.
6778	2.57	a	The gold was heavy on my back, and I was all the way to the car before I realized I had left the keys on Charles.
6779	3.1	a	The highway patrol was just bound to come by then.
6780	2.44	a	After that it was just connect the dots back to prison.
6781	2.8	a	The rental car records pointed to Acres, and there was enough blood on the knife to match DNA from Acres comb in the motel.
6782	2.78	a	They never bothered trying to explain how Acres made it into the country without a ticket on a plane or a boat.
6783	2.2	a	I didn't like his tone much.
6784	2.9	a	The prosecution liked the idea that Acres was my smuggler's mule.
6785	3.1	a	I was a one man gold cartel in the news.
6786	3.1	a	I'm just wondering what they'll think when they open that vault in Kentucky.
6787	2.8	a	And I still wonder why Charles picked me?
6788	2.87	a	"Maybe he didn't know anybody else with ""connections."""
6789	2.8	a	"But mostly, I'm wondering what will happen when I try to make those gestures, that ""device"" right here in my cell?"
6790	2.8	a	Acres said it was dangerous, but maybe I could find my way back to the mound or Easter Island even.
6791	2.0	a	I figure it can't be worse than the lethal injection that's waiting for me at dawn.
6792	2.37	a	I don't really believe I'll make it or I wouldn't say a thing.
6793	2.8	a	But if I do make it, it won't matter what I tell you, because there won't be a jail that can hold me.
6794	3.25	a	Wish me luck.
6795	2.8	a	I out of here.
6796	2.78	a	As I did, I noticed just how tired he looked around the eyes.
6797	3.0	a	Charlie Boy had been working hard lately, I figured.
6798	3.0	a	I knew every cop in Fairport and quite a few of the state police in Iowa, and I couldn't see them bringing old Charles in as a ringer.
6799	2.9	a	'm not a cop
6800	2.14	a	"He sighed and went on in softer, sadder voice, ""I guess I'm a thief now."""
6801	2.7	a	Let's make real clear right now that you were joking, buddy.
6802	2.2	a	Otherwise this conversation is over.
6803	2.6	a	I've got a parole officer to explain things to, and he wouldn't like that kinda talk.
6804	3.2	a	Right.
6805	3.1	a	Right.
6806	2.7	a	Charles looked out the window at the passing traffic push through dirty slush for awhile.
6807	2.9	a	Like I was saying.
6808	2.88	a	I'm a researcher, I've come into some valuable material that I would like to find a buyer for, and I don't want to have to explain myself to anyone.
6809	3.3	a	"He said he had a ""business proposition"" for me."
6810	2.45	a	"The pie came and I waited until the waitress was gone, before going on, ""Why me?"""
6811	3.1	a	You were the first person who came to mind.
6812	3.0	a	First person?
6813	3.0	a	How much of this 'valuable material' are we talking about?
6814	3.14	a	Four Hundred ounces for a start.
6815	3.0	a	Four Hundred.
6816	2.9	a	I pulled out my palm phone and looked up a number.
6817	3.0	a	He drained the last of his cup and tossed some bills on the table.
6818	3.1	a	I'm staying in town.
6819	2.8	a	"I thought about it and made a quick call, just telling a buddy that I was ""postponing our meeting,"" for a couple of hours, meaning he should come looking for me if I didn't show up."
6820	3.0	a	Charles might not look like much, but I hadn't made it through my life taking that kind of chance.
6821	3.1	a	I put away the cell and used the motion to cover checking the knife in my sleeve and used one leg to check the other in my sock.
6822	3.4	a	One of my best tricks was pulling a knife out of thin air.
6823	2.9	a	Sure.
6824	3.0	a	"Let's go,"" I said."
6825	3.0	a	The little desk was covered with large books filled with sticky notes, a pile of folders and papers and a laptop computer plugged into the phone line.
6826	3.1	a	This codex is one of the few remaining examples of a form of writing known as 'rongorongo.
6827	3.11	a	For a long time no one was able to decipher it, although by deduction, Steven Fischer deciphered some of it in nineteen ninety four.
6828	3.14	a	I told him I'd meet him for coffee at the diner down the street at seven.
6829	3.0	a	He mostly read creation stories off objects like the 'Santiago Staff' which said things like, 'All the birds copulated with fish: There issued forth the sun.
6830	2.8	a	But he ignored the inscriptions on skulls and the 'Birdman' statuette.
6831	3.0	a	It was those clues that started all of this.
6832	3.0	a	I didn't see much money in hieroglyphic porn.
6833	2.8	a	"He talked on about people with long ears who built the big statues, the ""moai"" and people with short ears who conquered the people with long ears and ate them and how the short eared people didn't really know the secrets of the long ears and had pulled down all the moai statues and destroyed some of the tablets."
6834	2.5	a	And how the missionaries came and the converted natives had destroyed more.
6835	3.1	a	"He flipped pages to another image, ""But notice something here in the arrangement of the moai."
6836	2.9	a	There was an ink drawing and writing in a tiny neat hand that I couldn't read from where I sat.
6837	3.0	a	I didn't see much resemblance except maybe there were about the same number of points in the cat's cradle thing in the diary and the number of dots on the map showing places where statues stood in a thin line around the coast of the island.
6838	3.0	a	he was already there, sitting in a booth, warming his hands on a cup of coffee.
6839	3.1	a	This is the diary of a mysterious explorer named Samuel Curlew who investigated a Mound Builder site in this area in the early eighteen hundreds.
6840	3.1	a	I want to show you that mound.
6841	3.1	a	And this mound is where you found gold?
6842	2.6	a	"I was confused enough I let the ""G word"" slip."
6843	2.5	a	Was this some crazy treasure hunt?
6844	2.0	a	Or maybe this guy was just a wacko who wanted to take me out on a dark road and kill me.
6845	2.63	a	No, it's more complicated than that, but I need to show you the mound for you to understand.
6846	2.8	a	He looked like jerked meat on the bone.
6847	3.1	a	The drawings and the books seemed to wake him up.
6848	3.6	a	He was smiling now and his eyes weren't so tired.
6849	2.4	a	"I was having serious cash flow issues back then and had payments to make, so I said, ""yes,"" but my patience was running out."
6850	3.0	a	It was dark as we left.
6851	2.8	a	When he killed the headlights there was no light but moonlight and stars on a light dusting of snow.
6852	2.8	a	A low, black hill blocked the sky right in front of us.
6853	2.8	a	"We spent the next hour stomping around the hill while he said things like, ""it was right here."""
6854	2.7	a	My patience was long gone, and I was back in the car to warming up when Acres tapped on the window and told me he had found whatever he was looking for.
6855	3.0	a	It looked like a bamboo walking stick.
6856	3.0	a	"""This is it,"" he leaned down and motioned for me to look at something on the ground."
6857	2.36	a	I casually slid a knife into my palm just in case.
6858	3.0	a	See how the lines form the pattern in the journal, the same one as the moai.
6859	3.0	a	So you drew this?
6860	2.14	a	He looked hurt and rapped on the ground with his finger.
6861	3.1	a	It's stone.
6862	3.1	a	Ancient.
6863	3.0	a	His tan was obviously deep and old, but it looked like a work tan, not the kind you get at the beach.
6864	3.1	a	"Here stand beside me,"" he said."
6865	3.0	a	I'm not sure if I can take you with me so I need to show you the device.
6866	3.0	a	Device?
6867	2.8	a	I expected him to pull out a gadget with blinking lights and was wondering which way to duck.
6868	3.1	a	It's like sleight of hand.
6869	3.14	a	OK, watch and remember this.
6870	3.0	a	I'm going to do it in two parts, last part first so it won't take effect.
6871	3.0	a	Remember to reverse the two parts when you actually do it.
6872	2.6	a	Stunned I watched as he made several ridiculous passes with his hands paused and nodded then did a sort of sign language stutter of some sort.
6873	3.0	a	I learned this from a skull shard rongorongo, they aren't all writing language.
6874	3.1	a	Some are just a memory device.
6875	3.3	a	"""Mnemonic."" I muttered, which seemed to please him."
6876	3.0	a	Mnemonic.
6877	3.2	a	Yes.
6878	3.0	a	They help in remembering steps in a ritual or ceremonial gestures.
6879	3.3	a	There's a long history of Polynesian gesture and dance language.
6880	2.89	a	Now you do it.
6881	3.6	a	He smiled and I could see his teeth in the moonlight.
6882	2.9	a	His hands were thin and huge knuckled with obvious callouses.
6883	2.1	a	I wanted to slug him, but he had the keys to the car back and I figured I'd humor him while I figured out how to get them without violating my parole.
6884	3.11	a	I didn't have much trouble duplicating his hand waving even though I hadn't paid much attention.
6885	2.9	a	I even swapped the two parts as he had asked.
6886	2.5	a	"I thought he was surprised at my dexterity when his jaw dropped, but he shouted, ""No!"" just before everything changed."
6887	3.1	a	I was standing on a perfectly flat square of dark stone.
6888	3.11	a	For as far as I could see by a weak, gray light the stone stepped up and down making little hills and terraces and platforms.
6889	3.1	a	I seemed to be somewhere in the middle -- there was as much above as below.
6890	2.3	a	The sky was dull and featureless and overcast.
6891	3.25	a	So, the mining business is treating you pretty good, huh Charles?
6892	2.2	a	I was in shock.
6893	3.0	a	We receive no government funding.
6894	3.1	a	The only way we can continue to provide guide dogs, at no cost, to someone who is blind or visually impaired, is through your support.
6895	3.6	a	Friends like you make it possible to give the gift of “Second Sight®”.
6896	3.0	a	“Second Sight®”
6897	3.25	a	I hope the Foundation can count on your caring donation today.
6898	3.2	a	Many people send gifts of $35, $50, or even $100 or more — whatever you are able to give to help maintain this vital service.
6899	3.1	a	“Second Sight”
6900	3.5	a	It’s the special bond — of a loving and working 24 hour a day partnership.
6901	3.1	a	“As a boy in Bosnia, I walked my dog.
6902	3.09	a	Now my guide dog, Franklin, walks me” says Sead.
6903	2.0	a	He was blinded at 15 by a Serbian missile.
6904	3.5	a	“After I got my beautiful black Lab, I finally felt like a human being again.
6905	3.6	a	Franklin has opened up a whole new world for me.
6906	3.0	a	A world I thought I would never have again.”
6907	2.78	a	As Pat explains, “Both my friends were zipping through crowds while I lagged behind, even though I was a fast cane walker.
6908	3.7	a	“Both my friends were zipping through crowds while I lagged behind, even though I was a fast cane walker. I envied their freedom and most of all, the incredible bond they both had with their guide dogs. With my Lab, Jay, I feel so wonderfully FREE!”
6909	3.0	a	I envied their freedom and most of all, the incredible bond they both had with their guide dogs.
6910	2.8	a	Hank says he was a good cane traveler for 17 years — but felt his freedom was curtailed particularly when traveling.
6911	2.4	a	“I had never had a pet.
6912	3.5	a	Having Aries just makes life so much easier.
6913	3.5	a	For one thing, people are nicer to you.
6914	4.0	a	People love dogs.
6915	3.2	a	They can relate to him and feel they have something to talk to you about.”
6916	2.9	a	mothers and fathers.
6917	3.0	a	As one of our donors in the New York area told us, “Sometimes you never see the good work your money does.
6918	3.7	a	“Sometimes you never see the good work your money does. I see the results... the guide does I’ve helped sponsor dramatically improve the lives of the men and women who receive them.”
6919	3.0	a	I see the results...
6920	3.4	a	the guide does I’ve helped sponsor dramatically improve the lives of the men and women who receive them.”
6921	3.14	a	Won’t you please take the time now to send your donation to give someone the priceless gift of independence?
6922	3.0	a	RS. For more information about the Guide Dog Foundation, or to become a Guide Dog Foundation volunteer, visit our website at www.guidedog.org.
6923	3.0	a	For too many, this is a daily reality — but today you can help make a difference.
6924	3.3	a	Having a guide dog allows a blind or visually impaired individual to experience the possibilities of life, not the limitations.
6925	3.0	a	For The Blind, Inc.
6926	3.0	a	It costs over $20,000 to breed, care for and train a guide dog like “Duke” and to train his blind teammate.
6927	3.0	a	We use Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and a cross between Labs and Goldens.
6928	3.0	a	Male and female dogs are used.
6929	3.0	a	And our dogs are specially bred for temperament and physical soundness.
6930	3.6	a	Every Foundation guide dog is given free of charge to someone who is blind or visually impaired.
6931	3.25	a	We are supported entirely by donations from generous individuals, corporations and foundations.
6932	2.8	a	Me, I found a space suit, but it was statistically unlikely that I, and whomever else has followed suit (pun intended), would manage to repair our ship before the less-than-twenty-four hours are up; yes, studies have been done.
6933	2.88	a	I could have started asking questions, but I wanted to get my bearings first.
6934	3.12	a	Tonight was for observation.
6935	3.0	a	I didn't bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more interesting people, though.
6936	2.86	a	They all looked the same: clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less apt, the hangers-on, the circle with whom the gossip was shared.
6937	3.0	a	If the barkeep was any indication, I suspected similarly high-class robots fulfilled other positions on the ship.
6938	2.9	a	How they were all powered was a mystery—as good as the technology got, a quality robot like that was still an energy sink.
6939	2.9	a	It was the brain, mostly; the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it did ate up a lot of resources.
6940	3.0	a	Sarah's crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled, all seemingly pleased to have a new set of ears to talk at.
6941	3.0	a	I slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised to find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract film—done in the style of old flatscreen movies—that I had seen during off-time at Geminia Station.
6942	3.5	a	By the end of the evening, when I finally followed the slow trickle of people out of the room, a satisfying haze had settled on my mind.
6943	3.88	a	It was nice, I decided.
6944	3.0	a	This ship.
6945	3.0	a	This life.
6946	3.0	a	Did it truly matter what the ship's origin was and why Jefferson had saved me, if now, I was content?
6947	2.9	a	I would wake late, checking the clock on my room's lightscreen to make sure I hadn't slept through brunch.
6948	3.12	a	I would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks.
6949	3.0	a	So, twenty-four hours.
6950	2.86	a	I did not ask questions.
6951	3.1	a	I told myself I should.
6952	3.0	a	I told myself that tonight, the observation period would end and I'd start puzzling out the ship's mystery.
6953	2.9	a	But I fell under the ship's sway.
6954	3.0	a	Give or take.
6955	2.6	a	About the time I was composing my last words in my head, trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like, that's when I heard a bell.
6956	3.22	a	I smothered thoughts of friends back on Earth—this was my long-awaited vacation, my clean break and my temporary retreat; I'd try contacting those friends tomorrow.
6957	3.5	a	I continued to care little for shipwide gossip, but our discussions of films and flicks, old and new, brought out my artistic, story-loving, argumentative side, a side of me I'd tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an engineer.
6958	3.2	a	It was a good life, if surreal.
6959	3.0	a	But I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end.
6960	3.2	a	Fact: Some places are timeless.
6961	2.73	a	Days passed, weeks passed, but I couldn't tell if it had been months or years since I was rescued.
6962	3.1	a	Now and then, a new face mingled in the crowd.
6963	2.71	a	Other faces washed out, fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the engines.
6964	2.43	a	So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in, I heard nothing.
6965	3.4	a	One of these evenings, we were gathered in the South Ballroom for post-dinner drinks, lounging on couches and watching other members of our populace move in circles on the dance floor.
6966	3.0	a	(The 'South' was in the title to suggest that there were more ballrooms.
6967	3.0	a	'South'
6968	2.9	a	There weren't.)
6969	2.8	a	Sarah's circle had picked up another newcomer, Adrienne, a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on Earth, let alone work on the ship in whose wreck Jefferson had found her.
6970	2.3	a	My first thought: I was going crazy.
6971	3.2	a	Maybe it was her curiosity, asking a question I should have asked long before, that turned the conversation serious; maybe there was just something special about that evening.
6972	2.87	a	Twenty-four hours of silence (vacuum, remember); was I hallucinating noises now?
6973	2.5	a	Maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life, hitting some threshold or some breaking point.
6974	3.0	a	Regardless, when Adrienne asked what the ship's purpose was, we all gave it a measure of thought.
6975	3.1	a	She swirled it speculatively.
6976	3.12	a	I watched Adrienne.
6977	2.5	a	“We can't live that long.”
6978	2.3	a	“Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think,” said Jefferson.
6979	3.1	a	Yeah, the captain was there, with the rest of us.
6980	3.0	a	He didn't drink, but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques.
6981	3.11	a	“Maybe we'll travel at the speed of light and we won't age,”
6982	3.2	a	“Maybe we'll travel at the speed of light and we won't age,” said Sarah, setting her wine glass on the little round end table by her couch.
6983	3.5	a	“Maybe we're already traveling at the speed of light.”
6984	3.0	a	“Relatively says it all.”
6985	2.7	a	Zheng scoffed.
6986	2.5	a	“Also impossible.
6987	3.12	a	We'd just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us.”
6988	2.9	a	said Sarah.
6989	3.1	a	“Aging is relative, anyway.
6990	3.0	a	Give our ancestors purpose.
6991	3.14	a	Keep their dreams alive.”
6992	3.25	a	“New hypothesis,”
6993	3.0	a	“New hypothesis,” suggested Kishori, slipping into the conversation.
6994	2.6	a	“No one's immortal.
6995	1.9	a	In fact, the opposite: We're all going to die.”
6996	2.11	a	“Bleak,”
6997	3.9	a	“But I like it.”
6998	2.62	a	Ray took a drink from his glass of ice water, and shook his head.
6999	2.9	a	“We're all going to die, so what better thing to do than enjoy the time we have?”
7000	3.0	a	Kishori gestured to the bar, the carpets, the paintings.
7001	3.14	a	Tiffany took a drink, thinking.
7002	3.9	a	“All the luxuries money can buy,”
7003	3.1	a	And accompanying the bell, I saw a light.
7004	2.75	a	Zheng looked skeptical.
7005	2.75	a	“Paid for how?”
7006	2.62	a	“Smuggling,”
7007	2.88	a	“Smuggling,” responded Kishori.
7008	3.12	a	Matter-of-fact.
7009	3.6	a	Jefferson snorted, amused.
7010	3.1	a	“Think about it,”
7011	3.0	a	“Think about it,” Kishori continued, “where else would we get the money to buy all this?”
7012	3.1	a	“where else would we get the money to buy all this?”
7013	2.25	a	“Renegade smugglers.
7014	3.0	a	So what's our cargo, eh, captain?”
7015	3.3	a	Zheng joked, leaning back in his chair with his glass of wine.
7016	2.9	a	Jefferson shook his head and stood up.
7017	3.0	a	“I'll leave you to your speculation,”
7018	2.9	a	“I'll leave you to your speculation,” he said.
7019	2.63	a	Now, there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense.
7020	3.3	a	A chorus of good nights followed him out the door.
7021	3.0	a	After the captain left, Zheng leaned in.
7022	2.37	a	“We're revolting,”
7023	2.6	a	“We're revolting,” he told us.
7024	2.45	a	“And I don't mean that you disgust me.
7025	3.13	a	“And I don't mean that you disgust me. No, we're the start of a rebellion. Did you hear what the captain said earlier? He means, we're going to change the future. The universe as we know it won't be the same.”
7026	2.9	a	No, we're the start of a rebellion.
7027	3.0	a	Did you hear what the captain said earlier?
7028	2.6	a	The universe as we know it won't be the same.”
7029	3.0	a	“Wouldn't we know it if we were part of a rebellion?
7030	2.86	a	Zheng shook his head.
7031	3.1	a	“The captain selected us for a reason. He has inside intelligence—how else would he know where to find us? He knows about us.”
7032	3.1	a	He has inside intelligence—how else would he know where to find us?
7033	2.89	a	He knows about us.”
7034	3.0	a	“Inside intelligence? Don't you remember, there's not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information.”
7035	3.0	a	Don't you remember, there's not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information.”
7036	3.38	a	“I still like my idea,” said Tiffany.
7037	2.6	a	Jefferson didn't share how he found people.
7038	2.88	a	He didn't share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were, or why he saved some people but not others.
7039	3.0	a	But then again, no one asked.
7040	3.0	a	He had been at this savior business longer than any of us.
7041	2.9	a	I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that.
7042	3.38	a	“We're going to mean something,”
7043	3.33	a	“We're going to mean something,” Zheng was saying.
7044	2.4	a	Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright.
7045	3.3	a	“What we do, rebelling against the oppression of the many governments that oppose us, we're going to leave a legacy.”
7046	3.11	a	He sounded certain.
7047	2.82	a	Ray, he shook his head, and broke the quiet he'd held most of the evening.
7048	2.3	a	“You've got it all wrong.”
7049	2.9	a	He looked from Sarah, to Adrienne, to Zheng, to Kishori and Tiffany, to me.
7050	2.7	a	“Obviously, we can't last longer than the rest of the universe.
7051	2.0	a	We aren't giving anyone purpose.
7052	2.33	a	We're not even going to leave a legacy.
7053	2.6	a	All we're doing is eating and drinking and shitting, breathing and fucking and nothing important, ever.
7054	2.62	a	We aren't special.”
7055	2.6	a	“Again, bleak,” commented Zheng.
7056	2.7	a	Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet.
7057	3.0	a	She leaned forward, setting her elbows on the foot stool in front of her.
7058	2.89	a	“You never know when it will end,”
7059	2.57	a	“You can't hold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget.
7060	2.4	a	“You can't hold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget. How long until the memories slip away? How long until all you remember is this, the ship, the thick red carpeting, the chandeliers, the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people? When your life, the reason you lived, the people and faces and places, the emotions you felt, who and what you loved, when all that is gone, faded, what will you have left?”
7061	2.6	a	How long until all you remember is this, the ship, the thick red carpeting, the chandeliers, the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people?
7062	3.1	a	I wondered how long Ray had been on this ship.
7063	2.62	a	I wondered why, if he had such an unpropitious outlook, he hadn't tried to change his situation.
7064	2.9	a	I wanted to ask, but he was still talking, and I was too self-conscious to interrupt.
7065	2.9	a	“You can try and try and try.
7066	3.0	a	Repeat stories to yourself in the artificial night, sketch faces in your mind.
7067	2.7	a	But words, if you repeat them enough times, lose their meaning.
7068	3.1	a	Emily emily em-ill-ee em-i-lee eh-mill-ee eh-mih-lee.
7069	2.88	a	My wife's name, once.
7070	2.8	a	Repeat it enough times, it's just a sound.
7071	3.3	a	These signals were the heralds of my saviors.
7072	3.75	a	No longer grounded.”
7073	3.1	a	Ray, he said, “If we last forever, if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out, it won't mean a thing to us.
7074	3.1	a	“If we last forever, if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out, it won't mean a thing to us. We won't care that we're last and we won't care that there are no more stars. We aren't angels. We're just dumb and lucky.”
7075	2.67	a	We aren't angels.
7076	3.1	a	We're just dumb and lucky.”
7077	2.7	a	“Pure dumb luck,”
7078	3.0	a	“Pure dumb luck,” he said.
7079	2.7	a	“Sorry,” said Ray.
7080	3.0	a	“How long ago was that?”
7081	3.0	a	asked Adrienne.
7082	2.56	a	“Leaving your wife, I mean.
7083	2.89	a	“Leaving your wife, I mean. Traveling on this ship.”
7084	2.7	a	The first words they said to me meant nothing.
7085	2.82	a	Ray, he looked down at his hands, folded together in his lap, fingers interlaced.
7086	2.5	a	“I don't know,”
7087	2.86	a	“I don't know,” he said.
7088	2.73	a	We were all quiet for a moment.
7089	2.6	a	Ray shrugged, then got up and left.
7090	3.2	a	We let him go.
7091	2.9	a	Silent.
7092	2.6	a	Self-conscious.
7093	2.72	a	More excuses were made, and after a few moments, only Adrienne and I were left sitting in the ballroom.
7094	3.0	a	She looked across the circle of couches at me.
7095	3.25	a	“What's your theory?”
7096	3.1	a	she asked me.
7097	2.5	a	I shrugged.
7098	3.2	a	I wasn't listening; I didn't care; I was going to live; I was going to keep breathing.
7099	3.0	a	“Not that long,”
7100	3.0	a	“Not that long,” I said.
7101	3.0	a	“A couple weeks, I guess.
7102	3.0	a	“A couple weeks, I guess. Maybe a month or two.”
7103	2.9	a	Maybe a month or two.”
7104	3.0	a	she asked.
7105	2.9	a	I shrugged.
7106	2.9	a	I hadn't been counting days.
7107	3.0	a	“What did you do before this?
7108	3.0	a	“What did you do before this? How were you found?”
7109	3.2	a	How were you found?”
7110	3.09	a	“I was an engineer.”
7111	2.88	a	I explained how my ship had malfunctioned, no warning at all.
7112	2.7	a	The explosions, the impossible rescue.
7113	3.14	a	She nodded.
7114	3.0	a	“The ship I was on, I guess that's what happened, too.
7115	2.8	a	“The ship I was on, I guess that's what happened, too. Some vital part broke, and... well, boom. It was all so fast.”
7116	2.3	a	Some vital part broke, and...
7117	2.9	a	well, boom.
7118	3.0	a	It was all so fast.”
7119	3.0	a	She took a sip of her drink, plain water because, she had explained earlier, she had never liked the taste of alcohol, then fixed her gaze on me.
7120	3.11	a	“I'm going to figure it out,”
7121	3.1	a	“I'm going to figure it out,” she said.
7122	2.9	a	“How and why this ship exists.
7123	3.0	a	“How and why this ship exists. I'll figure it out, then I'm going to find a way home.”
7124	2.86	a	I'll figure it out, then I'm going to find a way home.”
7125	3.0	a	The more I thought about it, the less sense the ship made.
7126	2.82	a	Next to those, nothing else mattered.
7127	2.7	a	Worse, Adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question.
7128	3.0	a	I had spent weeks asking nothing, contentedly getting nowhere.
7129	2.0	a	Fact: Adrienne intimidated me.
7130	2.9	a	Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.
7131	3.14	a	I resolved to break the pattern.
7132	3.3	a	Another evening, another chandeliered room, another swirl of conversations and dances and hor d'oevres.
7133	2.71	a	Another circle of chairs and couches, another uncomfortable question.
7134	3.0	a	Ray exchanged a glance with Zheng.
7135	2.3	a	“Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Alexis in days.
7136	2.75	a	“Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Alexis in days. I assumed he was indisposed.”
7137	2.88	a	I assumed he was indisposed.”
7138	3.18	a	Kishori nodded in agreement.
7139	2.9	a	After the first whoosh of the air being sucked away, there was lightning, but no thunder.
7140	2.9	a	I looked at Ray and raised an eyebrow.
7141	2.88	a	“What?”
7142	3.0	a	“Well,”
7143	2.6	a	“Well,” Ray said, slowly, “People do leave.
7144	2.82	a	“People do leave. The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same. But we see new faces.”
7145	3.0	a	The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same.
7146	2.9	a	Fact: Sound is a vibration.
7147	2.8	a	“You're sure it's not just some people being indisposed ? ”
7148	3.0	a	asked Adrienne, using Sarah's phrasing.
7149	2.86	a	“Keep adding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall.
7150	3.0	a	“Keep adding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall. A couple people staying in their rooms, even if you switch out the people, won't make a difference.”
7151	2.8	a	A couple people staying in their rooms, even if you switch out the people, won't make a difference.”
7152	3.0	a	He dropped the pecans back into the dish, one by one.
7153	3.0	a	“So where do they go?”
7154	2.88	a	Adrienne focused on Zheng.
7155	2.86	a	I cut in.
7156	3.0	a	“Maybe a better question is, does anyone ever come back?”
7157	2.8	a	Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink.
7158	2.75	a	After a moment, Ray said, “I don't think so.”
7159	2.7	a	“I don't think so.”
7160	3.0	a	“Are there patterns?”
7161	3.0	a	Adrienne asked.
7162	2.9	a	“Who leaves?”
7163	3.0	a	I hazarded a guess.
7164	2.8	a	“You don't notice, do you.”
7165	2.6	a	Sarah looked indignant.
7166	3.0	a	“Of course we notice.
7167	2.8	a	“Of course we notice. But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't really matter, does it.”
7168	3.0	a	But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't really matter, does it.”
7169	2.6	a	I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left, and failing.
7170	3.0	a	No one offered a different answer.
7171	3.0	a	I looked at Adrienne.
7172	3.43	a	Mission accomplished: Our routine insouciance had been disrupted.
7173	2.86	a	The scales had tipped.
7174	3.0	a	(I reserved the right to revise this opinion later.)
7175	3.0	a	From the looks on my companions' faces, I knew they were thinking the same.
7176	2.9	a	“How long have you been here?”
7177	2.75	a	The question, previously posed to me, was presented to the rest of our group (excluding Ray; Adrienne had been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill, recalling the last time the subject was broached).
7178	3.12	a	Sarah, she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass.
7179	3.0	a	A long time.
7180	3.0	a	Got to be months and months, at least.
7181	3.0	a	“You were here before I was,”
7182	3.1	a	“You were here before I was,” said Kishori, “and so was Tiffany.”
7183	2.9	a	“and so was Tiffany.”
7184	2.9	a	I looked at Zheng; he shrugged.
7185	2.8	a	“Time passes in a weird way here. I kept track for a while—thirty-eight days—but after that... I guess I didn't see the point.”
7186	2.9	a	I kept track for a while—thirty-eight days—but after that...
7187	2.6	a	I guess I didn't see the point.”
7188	3.1	a	Fact: Some places are timeless.
7189	3.0	a	“Why not?”
7190	3.0	a	asked Adrienne.
7191	3.0	a	“Days don't matter,”
7192	2.4	a	“Days don't matter,” he said.
7193	2.89	a	Tiffany nodded, but Kishori spoke before the other woman could.
7194	3.11	a	“Why are you so interested?”
7195	3.12	a	Adrienne met her gaze.
7196	3.0	a	“But we're not here forever,”
7197	2.87	a	“But we're not here forever,” objected Sarah.
7198	3.1	a	“Remember?
7199	2.9	a	“Remember? Alexis left.”
7200	2.9	a	Alexis left.”
7201	2.9	a	“Disappeared,” I corrected her.
7202	2.3	a	“We don't know how or why he left.
7203	3.0	a	Or where he went.”
7204	3.14	a	Zheng looked thoughtful.
7205	3.0	a	He picked up his glass, swirled the liquid around, took a sip, then set the glass back down.
7206	3.0	a	“Do you want to leave?”
7207	3.0	a	he asked.
7208	2.8	a	“Could you live anywhere else now?”
7209	3.22	a	I spoke up.
7210	3.3	a	“Yes,”
7211	3.29	a	“Yes,” I said.
7212	2.82	a	No one else said anything.
7213	2.9	a	Zheng, he addressed me again, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense, steady gaze.
7214	3.0	a	“You think that,” he said, “but is it true?
7215	2.67	a	“but is it true? Would you be happy back in a normal life, working and living and crying in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days?”
7216	2.86	a	Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.
7217	2.6	a	Asphyxiating my mind.
7218	2.9	a	I sat sideways in the armchair, feet dangling over one arm, neck resting against the other, absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I ruminated on the situation.
7219	2.4	a	The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful.
7220	3.1	a	There was a schedule advertising upcoming on-ship events, such as dance classes, craft sessions, and discussion groups, and a list of dinner invitations for me to respond to.
7221	2.9	a	A menu of display options, allowing me to customize all the lightscreen's superficial characteristics.
7222	3.0	a	That was all.
7223	2.2	a	I was discouraged and frustrated.
7224	3.12	a	I wanted to prove to Adrienne that I wanted solve the ship's mystery just as much as she did.
7225	2.86	a	I wanted to find something, anything, that would prove all this was normal and sane.
7226	2.8	a	And me, I guess I was one more piece in their puzzle.
7227	2.67	a	I didn't want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences.
7228	2.8	a	I wanted my contentment back.
7229	3.4	a	In one hand I balanced my plate of star-shaped crackers, globs of elegant dips and garnishes, little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale green plant, and an array of other delectable, bite-sized items.
7230	3.0	a	She glared at me, but obediently let me pull her along.
7231	2.8	a	“Tell me,”
7232	2.63	a	I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest, one more stranded survivor who was found.
7233	3.0	a	“what you have found.”
7234	2.25	a	She gave me a grumpy look that informed me, quite clearly, of her current opinion of me.
7235	1.9	a	“Not if you're going to be rude about it.”
7236	2.2	a	I sighed.
7237	2.3	a	“Sorry.”
7238	3.12	a	I wasn't, not really, but I'd lie to get the conversation going.
7239	3.0	a	I explained, in two brief sentences, my earlier impasse.
7240	2.6	a	“I don't know much,”
7241	2.44	a	“I don't know much,” she said, still annoyed but at least cooperative.
7242	3.0	a	She reviewed the information gleaned from our previous dinner conversations, adding, “I heard the captain say something yesterday, as I walking to the Pyrope Parlor.
7243	2.9	a	“I heard the captain say something yesterday, as I walking to the Pyrope Parlor. I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side, talking to a couple people, and they must not have known I was there. He said something about a wreck going well. And listen, when they came round the corner, Ray was with the captain.”
7244	2.8	a	I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side, talking to a couple people, and they must not have known I was there.
7245	3.0	a	He said something about a wreck going well.
7246	3.0	a	The next time the captain stopped by our group, Tiffany tagging along (pretending that she, too, was a social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone), we were ready.
7247	3.12	a	I was now one of them.
7248	2.8	a	“Is there a doctor on board?”
7249	3.0	a	asked Adrienne.
7250	2.27	a	“I've been having headaches.”
7251	2.7	a	It was a lie, but we needed information.
7252	3.0	a	Jefferson nodded.
7253	3.0	a	“Down past the Emerald Lounge, second door on the left.
7254	3.12	a	“Down past the Emerald Lounge, second door on the left. All hours.”
7255	2.89	a	All hours.”
7256	3.0	a	A robot, then.
7257	2.5	a	Medical AI were even more expensive than the barkeep.
7258	3.12	a	I wondered how many people it treated.
7259	2.9	a	Had anyone on the ship ever fallen seriously ill?
7260	3.0	a	“Does he age?”
7261	3.0	a	asked Adrienne.
7262	3.0	a	“The captain?”
7263	2.5	a	I shrugged.
7264	3.0	a	“I never thought about it.”
7265	3.0	a	Adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face.
7266	2.4	a	“That doesn't answer my question,” she said.
7267	3.0	a	“Not hungry?”
7268	3.0	a	asked Kishori sympathetically.
7269	2.2	a	“No,”
7270	2.25	a	“No,” said Adrienne.
7271	3.1	a	“I find it takes the edge off.”
7272	3.0	a	“She doesn't drink, remember?”
7273	3.0	a	said Kishori.
7274	2.6	a	“Maybe that's the problem,”
7275	3.2	a	“One hundred and forty-seven is a magic number,”
7276	2.91	a	“You ever heard of Dunbar?
7277	3.38	a	Well, we've got the perfect-size group right here.”
7278	2.6	a	Just enough for us all to be able to barely avoid killing each other.
7279	2.38	a	“If you dislike this place so much, why don't you do something about it?”
7280	2.3	a	“We can't,”
7281	3.0	a	“What would we do?”
7282	2.75	a	“You could force the captain to set down somewhere.
7283	2.3	a	“You could force the captain to set down somewhere. Let us off the ship. If he refuses, threaten him. If he still refuses, well, of all of us, isn't there someone who can drive a ship?”
7284	2.9	a	Let us off the ship.
7285	2.44	a	If he refuses, threaten him.
7286	2.9	a	If he still refuses, well, of all of us, isn't there someone who can drive a ship?”
7287	3.0	a	Floating alone, each of us facing the silence of the vacuum, we were found.
7288	2.1	a	“That's murder,”
7289	2.3	a	“That's murder,” objected Sarah.
7290	3.0	a	“That's survival, ”
7291	2.88	a	“That's survival, ” Adrienne corrected her.
7292	2.1	a	“Do you want to be stuck here for the rest of your life?”
7293	3.5	a	I shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the Emerald Lounge, looking out the windows at the stars.
7294	3.0	a	Times like that, running on less sleep than I should, alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire for the night, I had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it.
7295	3.0	a	That was tonight's melodramatic theme: the ephemeral nature of life.
7296	2.6	a	Everything to fade away, lost as dust and scattered atoms between the stars, and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born.
7297	2.5	a	Eyes bulging in panic, but no screams.
7298	3.0	a	This is our Hotel California.
7299	3.0	a	He had made us a constant.
7300	3.11	a	He made this ship—this life—a constant.
7301	3.0	a	The one thing that was known.
7302	2.38	a	We can never leave.
7303	2.91	a	But ultimately, this ship, its purpose, our purpose—did it matter?
7304	3.13	a	We each had our own theory.
7305	2.9	a	Maybe that was enough.
7306	3.0	a	“So, I'm on a ship now?
7307	3.0	a	“So, I'm on a ship now? You do this a lot?”
7308	3.2	a	Maybe that made us more real.
7309	2.89	a	Maybe it made us feel less alone.
7310	3.1	a	“Mind if I join you?”
7311	3.67	a	She smiled, then crossed the room to join me by the window, not waiting for an answer.
7312	3.0	a	“Some nights,”
7313	3.0	a	You do this a lot?”
7314	2.12	a	“I can't see the meaning in any of it. All these things I do, they're just to pass the time until I die.”
7315	3.0	a	“You don't see a meaning because there is no meaning,” she said.
7316	2.8	a	A woman, introduced as Tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful, shrugged.
7317	2.6	a	After all of it, as much as we feared being alone, we feared being vulnerable even more.
7318	2.8	a	Our instinct was to hide.
7319	3.3	a	“Look what I found,” Adrienne said.
7320	2.92	a	In her hands was a bottle.
7321	3.0	a	And what happens to Adrienne?
7322	2.11	a	I couldn't find her.
7323	3.1	a	Fact: Sound is a vibration.
7324	3.0	a	The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit is three hundred and forty-three meters per second, or one thousand one hundred twenty-five feet per second.
7325	3.0	a	“Up his dosage,”
7326	3.0	a	“Up his dosage,” I heard the captain say.
7327	2.66	a	I ran.
7328	2.7	a	I didn't want to forget.
7329	2.0	a	I didn't want to be harvested.
7330	2.7	a	The last thing I remember, I was tearing down the corridors.
7331	3.0	a	“Now and then.”
7332	2.78	a	Life boats, I thought.
7333	3.0	a	Every ship had life boats.
7334	3.0	a	In case of emergency, break glass.
7335	3.0	a	I'd find one.
7336	3.0	a	I'd put on a space suit, I'd get out of this ship, I'd find civilization again.
7337	2.4	a	“What about my crewmates? Why didn't you save them?”
7338	3.0	a	A planet.
7339	3.0	a	Some other ship.
7340	2.5	a	Any place but this place.
7341	1.75	a	Failing all else, I'd suffocate.
7342	2.4	a	Alone.
7343	3.37	a	“Relax,”
7344	2.4	a	“Relax,” he told me, sliding a needle into my arm.
7345	2.75	a	Why didn't you save them?”
7346	3.13	a	“It'll pass,” he told me.
7347	3.0	a	He held me in his arms until I stopped flailing.
7348	2.45	a	I can never leave.
7349	2.37	a	Who would tell his girl how he had died?
7350	3.57	a	Quiet and peaceful, right?
7351	2.5	a	“Couldn't,”
7352	2.7	a	“Couldn't,” said the captain.
7353	3.2	a	Jefferson, he called himself, clean-shaven and smart, a picture of the perfect entrepreneur.
7354	3.1	a	An opportunist and a businessman, that was Jefferson.
7355	3.0	a	“We're selective about our passengers,”
7356	3.3	a	“You fit the bill.
7357	3.2	a	“You fit the bill. They didn't.”
7358	2.67	a	They didn't.”
7359	3.33	a	Tiffany, she looked at the captain, grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder.
7360	3.0	a	She turned to me.
7361	2.89	a	“Come on,”
7362	3.2	a	“Come on,” she said, before I could say anything else, “let's get you settled in.”
7363	3.0	a	>Hotel California
7364	3.4	a	“let's get you settled in.”
7365	2.63	a	No time for questions.
7366	2.86	a	No time for answers.
7367	3.29	a	The ship had all the usual accoutrements (artificial gravity, tastefully painted walls, sound dampeners to keep the noise of the engines from driving the crew batshit insane, recycled air systems), and a few less-usual: lush carpeting, lighting that was decorative as well as functional, spacious corridors.
7368	3.8	a	This was heaven.
7369	3.0	a	No seventy-two virgins, but it would do.
7370	3.0	a	“Where are we going?”
7371	3.0	a	Tiffany looked back.
7372	3.0	a	“To your quarters.
7373	3.1	a	“To your quarters. It's not far; you're not going to get blisters.”
7374	2.86	a	It's not far; you're not going to get blisters.”
7375	3.0	a	“No, I meant, where's the ship going?
7376	3.0	a	She gave me a look, pitying and a little pleased that she got to be the one to share the news.
7377	3.5	a	“Honey,”
7378	4.11	a	“Honey,” she said, “You're going to be delighted.
7379	3.7	a	“You're going to be delighted. Destination everywhere. Destination nowhere.”
7380	3.18	a	Destination everywhere.
7381	3.0	a	Destination nowhere.”
7382	3.0	a	Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium.
7383	1.8	a	This was hell.
7384	2.3	a	I died in those last moments, suffocating on my own exhaled breath, and this, this was my reward.
7385	3.1	a	Fact: The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit is three hundred and forty-three meters per second, or one thousand one hundred twenty-five feet per second.
7386	3.2	a	It took me a couple days to realize I was, in fact, still alive.
7387	3.5	a	I mean, sure, I'd had my moment of elation when I had first realized I'd been rescued, but it didn't sink in.
7388	2.7	a	I swore, if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again, giving the camera a cheesy thumbs-up from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches, I'd kiss a monkey.
7389	3.1	a	Fact: I wasn't dead.
7390	3.0	a	The lightscreen provided had informed me when and where official meals were taking place, but I hadn't bothered to acknowledge the invitations.
7391	2.0	a	I've heard there are a number of stages of grief and shock; I guess I was working my way through them.
7392	2.7	a	Initially, I couldn't figure out why—I hadn't requested any be sent.
7393	3.4	a	Then I realized, someone must have noticed I hadn't left, and was nice enough to send food my way.
7394	3.75	a	The accompanying bottle of wine was a nice touch.
7395	3.0	a	I must have consumed it, too, because later on, the plates and the bottle were both empty.
7396	2.86	a	I spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed, staring up at the little etched swirls in the ceiling, or slumped in the old-fashioned armchair, staring out the windows at the stars.
7397	3.7	a	Man, was it good to be done with that stage.
7398	2.4	a	It was time to find out what hell looked like.
7399	2.17	a	Fact: Hell is other people.
7400	3.38	a	Sure, the ship was spacious.
7401	3.2	a	But we were all on this ship, and we were on it together.
7402	2.9	a	Cliques form in any decent-sized group of people.
7403	3.0	a	Metaphorically, of course.
7404	3.0	a	Me, I was singled out by Sarah, an unassuming forty-something lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the other.
7405	3.3	a	She sidled up to me as I was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro cream dip onto a plate.
7406	3.11	a	The plate, by the way, was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish, paprika-dusted deviled eggs, toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese, and balls of meat smothered in a tomato-based sauce.
7407	3.86	a	Compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship, it was mouthwateringly, lip-smackingly gorgeous.
7408	3.62	a	I wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days had been similarly amazing.
7409	2.7	a	I decided it couldn't have been.
7410	3.67	a	“Liking the taste of the sweet life, eh? I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis—you must be the new pickup.”
7411	3.22	a	I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis—you must be the new pickup.”
7412	2.6	a	I looked longingly at the slices of cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar, but didn't protest.
7413	3.0	a	The bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot.
7414	3.4	a	It turned toward Sarah's wave and acknowledged her with a nod, moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her.
7415	3.45	a	I marveled at the robot's smoothness and coordination.
7416	3.2	a	Clearly, it was a high-end model.
7417	3.18	a	Sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and pulled me away from the bar for more introductions, with Alexis trailing after us.
7418	3.0	a	I spent the evening listening, mostly.
7419	3.12	a	Listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food provided.
7420	3.2	a	No one minded; Sarah's inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter.
7421	3.1	a	Ray, a plump man who was grey where he wasn't bald.
7422	3.1	a	Zheng, short and dark and lean, with a very intense gaze.
7423	3.1	a	Kishori, petite, her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached nearly to her waist.
7424	2.9	a	I categorized them based on their appearances, hoping I'd be able to pick them out of the crowd again later.
7425	2.9	a	This is more than the person would have sans space suit.
7426	2.88	a	Most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day-to-day activities, how so-and-so had been seen in so-and-so's table at lunch and my wasn't that a surprise, and why hadn't the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night, but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth, didn't they, and this was somehow an interesting fact.
7427	3.0	a	After the first half-hour, I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight.
7428	2.89	a	“accidental”
7429	2.25	a	And almost 6,000,000 companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout America.
7430	1.7	a	needless deaths that could have been stopped!
7431	2.3	a	And with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on, I’m sure you can understand why the work of The Humane Society of the United States is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people, like you, to help us bring an end to animal suffering, abuse and neglect.
7432	2.78	a	But while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty, we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources.
7433	3.0	a	It’s a difficult problem, because we have to fight the well-financed and powerful agri-business and research industries, but we do our best to protect the animals.
7434	2.6	a	Right now, the problems are mounting and we need all the help we can get to stop animal cruelty.
7435	3.29	a	And that’s where you can help.
7436	3.63	a	You can be a lifesaving “friend” to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of The HSUS and asking them to become vigilant in safe-guarding the lives of ALL animals.
7437	3.14	a	“friend”
7438	3.09	a	Today, we are placing special emphasis on pet adoption.
7439	3.1	a	I hope you will visit your local animal shelter and consider adopting a dog or cat into your home.
7440	3.3	a	Dear Friend of Animals,
7441	3.4	a	It’s a wonderful way to enjoy their companionship and save the life of a loving animal, too.
7442	3.2	a	I also hope you will give a big boost to our work to protect all animals by sending a generous tax-deductible donation today.
7443	3.2	a	Your gift of at least $5 or $10 or even $15, will help The HSUS save millions of animals.
7444	3.33	a	I know you care deeply for the well-being of all animals.
7445	2.9	a	Sincerely, President
7446	3.0	a	But your help of $5 or $10 or even $15 is absolutely needed today.
7447	3.2	a	Please take this moment to be as generous as possible to send your best gift today, and don’t forget to use your free colorful pet stickers and name labels enclosed.
7448	2.7	a	I wish I could tell you that everyone is concerned about protecting earth’s animals -- dogs, cats, farm animals and wildlife.
7449	3.6	a	Thanks in advance.

7473	4.0	a	Perfect solution.
7474	2.9	a	April 27, 2009 9:53 AM Padraic: Why aren't you a supporter of cap & trade?
7475	3.2	a	Isn't a mandatory scheme going to moresuccesful than voluntary measures?
7476	3.0	a	April 27, 2009 10:20 AM lessig: I favor a mandatory scheme -- internalize your externality.
7477	2.62	a	It seems like a complicated partial version of that, created by the same genius quants who gave us the mess on wall street, that is designed to generate large fees finance types.
7478	3.6	a	A cap & trade system worked very well at reducing sulfur dioxide pollution in the US, finance types and all.
7479	3.1	a	You're right that a carbon tax is definitely simpler, but there are upsides to cap & trade as well (such as the fact that the market will drive the price up, whereas a tax won't increase unless Congress wants it to).
7480	3.0	a	Re: your green culture talk, I think you are misappropriating the Gore clip: isn't he saying that your money would be better spent on political candidates and organizations that push for mandatory internalizing of externalities (changing the laws) instead of on carbon offsets (changing the lightbulbs)?
7481	2.75	a	My problem with carbon offsets and other voluntary measures is that given the finite amount of money, energy and attention we have to push for the environment, I feel like the opportunity cost of these measures is too high compared to policy-oriented actions, the citizen role that Gore referred.
7482	2.6	a	For example, Earth Hour would be much more productive if it were a global rally for carbon taxes; instead we de-politicize it and entertain the idea that voluntarily turning off lights will stop climate change.

7488	3.33	a	April 27, 2009 2:51 PMCathy: When you book a route on United it tells you how many miles it will accrue, pre-bonus, for each leg.
7489	3.1	a	(I use it to calculate how many I'll get towards my premier status.)
7490	3.1	a	It's a tiny link they move around from time to time, but look for it near where the seat selection option is.
7491	2.91	a	One reason we're late (other than the obvious) is the insane complexity in calculating it well.
7492	3.0	a	You should see this on a screen before you purchase the ticket, and possibly also after.
7493	3.0	a	April 27, 2009 4:45 PM Brad Templeton: When I got to United's site it has two columns, one for true miles flown (sort of) and one for elite bonus.
7494	3.2	a	So cut and paste into your spreadsheet and it should be fine.
7495	3.0	a	However, it does show 500 for the short haul flights, but I bet those are mostly L.A. so you can fill in the real mileage to L.A. on those, it should not take long.

7497	2.9	a	April 28, 2009 9:03 AM Jardinero1: The only way to reduce your carbon footprint, is to reduce your carbon footprint, period.
7498	2.5	a	Paying someone else to do something they are doing, already, does not reduce your carbon footprint one bit.
7499	2.8	a	If you don't believe that and still insist on paying someone else to consume less, then please consider paying me.
7500	2.5	a	I travel way too much.
7501	3.0	a	My wife and I telecommute.
7502	2.6	a	We rarely travel.
7503	3.2	a	I ride my bike to the grocery store.
7504	2.89	a	Both of our cars are high mpg and rarely used.
7505	3.0	a	They are both ten years old and we probably won't replace them for another ten years.
7506	3.4	a	I just finished insulating my house and installed high efficiency windows and HVAC.
7507	3.12	a	I keep the thermostat high in the summer and low in the winter.
7508	2.7	a	But to calculate it accurately requires churning through a pile of flights.
7509	3.1	a	I removed all the turf from my property and replaced it with vines and perennials.

7512	3.44	a	I would gladly accept the sum of fifteen thousand dollars from Prof Lessig or anyone else to offset his carbon heavy lifestyle.
7513	3.0	a	In return, I would submit to an audit of my lifestyle and I would issue him a certificate stating the amount of his carbon offset.
7514	2.44	a	More modern, but just as dumb.

7533	3.12	a	"""Carbon Offset Program."""
7534	2.89	a	The cost for large companies to make any updates to their e-commerce sites is significant, another factor in keeping the type of program you'd like from being available.

7675	3.1	a	I was noodling on Vampires the other day, but also lumped Zombies, Pirates and Ninjas in the mix.
7676	3.0	a	So it's not just a matter of knowing when to jump off the Vampire merry-go-round, it's knowing when (and where) to jump back on.
7677	3.1	a	If you jumped off Vampires would you have known to jump back on in time to publish Twilight?

7966	3.2	a	Both sides are in talks to settle the dispute.
7967	2.9	a	A spokeswoman for Crum & Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting move.
7968	2.8	a	She said the move would result in a after-tax charge of less than $4 million to be spread over the next three quarters.
7969	2.8	a	Property/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters, as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake have resulted in huge payments.
7970	2.9	a	"""It's a cosmetic move,"""
7971	3.0	a	"""It's a cosmetic move,"" said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co."
7972	3.0	a	According to Upjohn's estimates, only 50% to 60% of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan.
7973	3.1	a	Upjohn further estimated that about 50% of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced.
7974	3.0	a	As a result, Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide.
7975	3.34	a	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $38.875 apiece.
7976	3.0	a	"An Upjohn spokesman said he had ""heard nothing"" to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company, which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation."
7977	2.9	a	Upjohn officials said they couldn't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees, and how many, will participate in the retirement plan.
7978	3.11	a	The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors.
7979	2.37	a	Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs, the spokesman said.
7980	3.12	a	"But the pharmaceutical company said it ""anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan's implementation will more than offset short-term costs."""
7981	3.25	a	"""anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan's implementation will more than offset short-term costs."""
7982	2.6	a	Upjohn Co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge.
7983	3.3	a	In addition, Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay.
7984	3.0	a	"Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and ""an effective headcount-control program."""
7985	3.11	a	"""an effective headcount-control program."""
7986	3.14	a	But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have, because few jobs will end up being eliminated.
7987	2.8	a	Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company.
7988	3.11	a	Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said.
7989	2.7	a	Waertsilae Marine's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. Carnival, which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine, presented claims for $1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week.
7990	2.9	a	Waertsilae Marine's bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court.
7991	3.2	a	The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said.
7992	2.91	a	The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships.
7993	3.09	a	Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities.
7994	3.14	a	Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said.
7995	2.88	a	Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures, which required higher advertising spending.
7996	2.8	a	For the year, pet food volume was flat, the company said.
7997	2.45	a	Ralston said its Eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in South America.
7998	2.64	a	The St. Louis company earned $45.2 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $84.9 million, or $1.24 a share, a year earlier.
7999	3.1	a	Ralston shares closed yesterday at $80.50, off $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
8000	3.38	a	Sales in the latest period were $1.76 billion, a 13% increase from last year's $1.55 billion.
8001	3.2	a	For the year ended Sept. 30, Ralston earned $422.5 million, or $6.44 a share, up 8.9% from $387.8 million, or $5.63 a share.
8002	2.5	a	Ralston Purina Co. reported a 47% decline in fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market.
8003	3.25	a	This year's results included a gain of $70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations.
8004	2.57	a	Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville, N.C., the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company.
8005	2.73	a	The battery plant, which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products, will be closed over the next year or so, a spokesman said.
8006	2.8	a	They need only position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait.
8007	2.5	a	"""You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time,"" Mr. Matchett said, adding : ""It's a pretty good bet they won't get caught."""
8008	3.0	a	The only way to catch an electronic thief, he said, is to set him up with erroneous information.
8009	2.78	a	Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said.
8010	3.0	a	By contrast, European firms will spend $150 million this year on electronic security, and are expected to spend $1 billion by 1992.
8011	2.86	a	That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage.
8012	3.0	a	Already many foreign firms, especially banks, have their own cryptographers, conference speakers reported.
8013	2.8	a	Still, encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy.
8014	2.57	a	"Moreover, he said, technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they've been ""erased"" from a computer's memory."
8015	3.0	a	He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read.
8016	2.4	a	No personal computer, not even the one on a chief executive's desk, is safe, this speaker noted.
8017	3.0	a	He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East.
8018	2.7	a	"""Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies,"" said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md."
8019	3.1	a	Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company, which hadn't been invited to submit a bid.
8020	2.7	a	"It ""may well be"" that theft of business data is ""as serious a strategic threat to national security"" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs."
8021	3.0	a	The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group.
8022	2.6	a	We don't know who is winning the drug war in Latin America, but we know who's losing it -- the press.
8023	2.43	a	Over the past six months, six journalists have been killed and 10 kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas -- who often are one and the same -- in Colombia.
8024	2.0	a	An hour later, the paper's circulation manager, Miguel Soler, was shot and killed near his home.
8025	2.63	a	The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the Bogota newspaper's offices if it continued to distribute in Medellin.
8026	1.9	a	They bombed the Bogota offices last month, destroying its computer and causing $2.5 million in damage.
8027	3.0	a	El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff.
8028	2.75	a	"At Monterrey, publisher Luis Gabriel Cano, although shaken by the murders, issued a statement saying: ""We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking."
8029	2.6	a	"They want to terrify the press and in particular El Espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war."""
8030	2.9	a	The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions, but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today's editions.
8031	3.0	a	Many will use a common editorial.
8032	2.3	a	"A final statement yesterday said: ""While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere, the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship: death by assassination."""
8033	2.4	a	The report charged that Panama's Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before.
8034	2.14	a	"""Noriega has closed every independent newspaper, radio and television station and arrested, tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters,"" the statement declared."
8035	2.5	a	"It added: ""In Cuba, public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere, repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever."""
8036	2.0	a	Over the past 12 years, at least 40 journalists have died there.
8037	2.38	a	"And in Nicaragua, promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas ""have not materialized."""
8038	2.3	a	As it happens, the four countries cited, Colombia, Cuba, Panama and Nicaragua, are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left-wing politics.
8039	3.12	a	Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges; he backed their takeover of Nicaragua.
8040	2.2	a	In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed.
8041	2.67	a	Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel.
8042	2.55	a	"""If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,"" he told the Journal's David Asman recently."
8043	2.44	a	The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing.
8044	2.88	a	He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived.
8045	3.1	a	Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized.
8046	3.0	a	Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid.
8047	3.14	a	President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem.
8048	2.62	a	After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance.
8049	2.5	a	The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America, the United States, the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter-American Press Association in Monterrey, Mexico, this week.
8050	3.22	a	After all, conservation begins with saving those at-risk places -— our forests and deserts, wetlands and oceans, mangroves and coral reefs — that provide a lifeline for precious animals and plants.
8051	3.1	a	To this end, we’ve designated some 200 ecoregions, those with the most outstanding and diverse habitats, as our Global 200.
8052	3.5	a	We’re now creating model projects in 25 of these high-priority areas -- in order to balance conservation with people’s need to use natural resources to sustain their livelihoods.
8053	2.71	a	As a member of World Wildlife Fund, you know that our efforts are essential to preserving the astonishing, yet desperately threatened diversity of life here on Earth.
8054	2.9	a	While we still have the chance.
8055	3.25	a	So in addition to our efforts to conserve wildlife preserves, we’ll escalate our trailblazing program to find alternatives for traditional tiger-based medicines ... rescue more rhinos in Kenya and Nepal through our ambitious translocation projects ... complete the first survey of China’s pandas in over a decade ... and fight to halt all commercial whaling, as well as the whale meat trade.
8056	3.2	a	We’ll also award more small grants through our Species Action Fund to help a wide range of animals, including whooping cranes, giant river otters, and Tibetan antelopes.
8057	3.1	a	And with your increased commitment, we can battle against destructive global forces that transcend regional and national boundaries.
8058	3.0	a	“Forests for Life Campaign”
8059	3.25	a	This will protect at least 10% of each different type of forest found in every country.
